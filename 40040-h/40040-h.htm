<br><br>

<p>Dear Children,&mdash;If you were old enough to go to
the bookseller and ask for a book that would tell
you about the flowers you see growing in the
woods and fields in spring and summer-time, you
would find there were already a great many books
which had been written with that purpose.</p>

<p>If you examined a few of these books, you would
discover that in many the pictures of the flowers
were not coloured, and that in these books the
flowers were very difficult to recognise. And I
think you would at once tell the bookseller you
wished a flower-book with coloured pictures,
where the flowers looked like real flowers.</p>

<p>Then you would examine more books, some of
which have beautiful coloured pictures showing
every flower that grows in our country. These
books are very large and cost a great deal of
money. You would see, too, quite small books
which said they could tell about the common
flowers we find in our country walks. And I
think you would buy one of these.</p>

<p>But next day, suppose you were to find a bright
blue flower growing in the field, and wished very
much to know what it was called. You would open
the flower-book and begin to look at the pictures,
and there you would discover that the first picture<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
showed a yellow flower, the next a red, the third
a purple, a white or a blue, and you might have to
turn over all the pages in the book before you
found the flower you sought.</p>

<p>After you had looked at the picture of your blue
flower, I think you would wish to know something
more about the flower, and would like to read the
writing to find out what it said.</p>

<p>But I am afraid you would not be able to understand
what the flower-book told. There would
be such long words telling about things you had
never heard of, and you would begin to wonder
if only older people could find out what books
had to say about flowers.</p>

<p>Now this new flower-book is written just for
the purpose of telling little children about the
flowers. And in order to make it easy, the blue
flowers have all been put together in one part of
the book, the yellow in another, and the white in
a third group; so you can at once know in what
part of the book you will see a picture of any
flower you find.</p>

<p>And I have made the writing which tells about
each flower very easy, with as few new words
as possible, so I hope you will be able to read it
yourself, and find out how many wonderful and
beautiful things there are in the flower-world
which you might not notice unless you were told
what to look for.</p>

<p>There are four new words you must learn to
understand before you begin to read this book.<span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span></p>

<p>The first word is <span class="smcap">CALYX</span>, and it means a covering.
When the flowers are still babies, or buds,
as they are called in flowerland, they are so soft
and tender that too much rain, or a cold wind or
a night of frost would do them harm. So nearly
every flower has been given a warm covering
which is folded closely round the tiny bud to
protect it. Sometimes this calyx, or covering,
is all in one piece like a cup, and the bud sits
safely inside. But very often it is made up of
five or six or more pieces, and when this is the
case, these separate pieces are called sepals.</p>

<p>These <span class="smcap">SEPALS</span> are very often green, like leaves,
but you may have white sepals, or yellow sepals,
or blue sepals or pink sepals. You will learn all
about them after you know all that is in this
flower-book and are able to read a more difficult
one.</p>

<p>The third new word you must know the meaning
of, is <span class="smcap">PETALS</span>. Nearly every flower has petals.
They are the beautiful coloured leaves of the
flower that are within the calyx. It is these
lovely petals, pink in the rose, yellow in the
buttercup, red in the poppy, and blue in the
forget-me-not, that most of us mean when we
talk of flowers, and it is these soft, silky petals
which attract us, and not us only, but the birds
and the bees and the butterflies, which all visit
the gay flowers. These petals are among the
most beautiful things in this wonderful world.</p>

<p>The fourth new word you must try to remember<span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span>
is <span class="smcap">STAMENS</span>. The stamens are not very attractive,
but they are very important to the flower,
as without them there could be no new seeds,
and if there were no new seeds we should presently
have no more flowers.</p>

<p>The stamens are usually fine, slender threads
which grow either singly, or in little bunches or
in a ring within the circle of petals. Each slender
thread has a fat little head at the end, a purple
head, or a pink head, or a red head, or, very often,
a yellow head. And this stamen head is filled
with fine powder which is needed to make the
new seeds grow.</p>

<p>These four, <span class="smcap">CALYX</span>, <span class="smcap">SEPALS</span>, <span class="smcap">PETALS</span>, and
<span class="smcap">STAMENS</span>, are the only new words you will have
to learn in order to understand all that is written
in this little flower-book, and I hope that, when
summer comes, you will try to find all the plants
that I have written about here, and that you will
be able to tell the names, without reading them,
of every flower of which Miss Kelman has made
you a picture.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<h3>1. LESSER CELANDINE</h3>


<p>This is one of the first flowers you will see in
springtime. It covers the ground in patches
in every wood, and you will find it too under the
hedges and on banks by the roadside.</p>

<p>The flower has eight long narrow petals, which
are much narrower and more pointed than those
of the Buttercup.</p>

<p>When the Celandine is still in bud the outside
of these petals is beautifully streaked with purple.
But when the flower opens in the sunshine,
the petals are a bright yellow colour, and are as
glossy as if they were wet.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower there is a ring of
yellow stamens with a cluster of green seed-vessels
amongst them.</p>

<p>Behind the coloured petals are three narrow
pointed sepals. These protect the flower when
it is in bud.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Celandine are dark and
glossy, with wavy edges, and each leaf has a stalk
of its own.</p>

<p>If you look carefully at one of these leaves you
will see that the stalk is flattened at the foot.
This helps it to clasp the main stem more easily.</p>

<p>The root is divided into five or six hard little
brown fingers. These brown fingers are called
tubers, and each tuber, if planted separately, will
produce a new plant.</p>

<br><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<h3>2. BULBOUS BUTTERCUP</h3>

<p>In spring the Bulbous Buttercup is found everywhere,
filling the meadows with its sunshiny
flowers.</p>

<p>Each flower has five glossy yellow petals which
do not lie flat open as in the Celandine, but form a
cup, a yellow cup or Buttercup.</p>

<p>At the base of each petal you find a small honey
pouch, which the bees love to visit.</p>

<p>When the flower is still in bud, the yellow petals
are almost covered by five pale-green hairy sepals.
You can see only the yellow tips peeping out. But
when the flower opens, these hairy green sepals
fold back close round the stalk.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower is a thick cluster of
yellow-headed stamens with a knot of green seed-vessels
in the middle.</p>

<p>The stalk on which the flower grows is slightly
hairy, and has a narrow groove on one side.</p>

<p>The root is shaped like a small turnip, and has a
great many white threads growing out of it.</p>

<p>The leaves of this Buttercup are dark green, with
soft hairs all over them. They are shaped very
irregularly, and are deeply cut up all round the
edges.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. MEADOW BUTTERCUP</h3>

<p>The Meadow Buttercup is abundant all over
the country. It grows beside the Daisy in
every field and hedge-bank.</p>

<p>In this Buttercup the flower has five bright
glossy yellow petals, which open out flat and are
not cup-shaped as in the Bulbous Buttercup.</p>

<p>There is a hard green knot of seed-vessels in
the centre of the flower, with a ring of yellow
stamens all round it. When the yellow stamens
and petals fall off, this bunch of seed-vessels
grows bigger and bigger, until it looks like a
small green raspberry.</p>

<p>Outside the yellow petals are five pale-green
sepals. These remain close behind the yellow
flower and do not fold back against the stalk as
in the Bulbous Buttercup.</p>

<p>The flower-stalk is slightly hairy, but it is not
grooved.</p>

<p>The green leaves are dark, and are covered
with soft hairs. Each leaf is divided into three
parts, which are very deeply cut up all round the
edge.</p>

<p>You will easily recognise this Buttercup if you
remember three things.</p>

<p>1. The flower-stalk has no groove.</p>

<p>2.  The little green sepals do not fold back close
to the stalk.</p>

<p>3.  The root has no bulb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>4. MARSH MARIGOLD</h3>

<p>This is one of our handsomest wildflowers. It
grows abundantly in springtime by the side
of ponds, or on the marshy edge of a slow-running
stream. It looks like a large, thick Buttercup.</p>

<p>The Marsh Marigold is closely related to the
Buttercup family, though it differs from the Buttercups
in various ways.</p>

<p>The five bright yellow petals of the flowers are
glossy, and have little veins running up from the
bottom.</p>

<p>In the centre of these petals there is a big bunch
of yellow stamens, with a group of green seed-vessels
amongst them.</p>

<p>If you look at the back of an open flower you
will see that there are no green sepals such as
there are in the Buttercups.</p>

<p>The flower-stalks are thick and hollow, with
ridges along the sides. They snap off easily when
gathered, but very soon they lose their stiffness
and become soft and flabby. This means they are
thirsty, and if you give them plenty of water to
drink they will soon be as stiff as when they were
growing.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Marsh Marigold are
dark above, but underneath they are much lighter.
They are very glossy and smooth, and each leaf is
covered with a fine network of veins.</p>

<p>In shape they are like a heart with crinkled
edges.</p>

1. WALLFLOWER.  2 WILD MUSTARD. <br>3. HEDGE MUSTARD.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. WALLFLOWER</h3>

<p>The Wallflower, as its name tells you, likes to
grow on walls. In early spring you will see
it on the top of old walls or high up on the broken
roof of a ruined castle. How did it get there?
The wind or the birds must have carried the seed.</p>

<p>The flowers are a rich golden yellow, and they
have a delightful scent. Each flower has four
beautiful petals, which are broad above with a long
strap forming the lower part.</p>

<p>In the centre where these four petals meet, you
can just see the tips of the stamens peeping out:
but the seed-vessel is hidden from sight.</p>

<p>The four sepals are a dark purple colour, and
they form a cup in which the lower or strap-shaped
part of the petal is held.</p>

<p>Those flowers which are nearest the foot of the
stem open first. You will often find eight or ten
yellow flowers blooming at the same time and a
bunch of dark purple buds at the end of the
stem.</p>

<p>The stem of the Wallflower is tough and
woody near the ground, but further up it is green
and smooth.</p>

<p>The leaves are narrow pointed straps with
smooth edges. They are dark green, but sometimes
they have a touch of purple at the tips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. WILD MUSTARD</h3>

<p>This is a plant the farmers are very sorry to see.
They do not want it among the corn, but in
springtime the fields are often covered with its
yellow flowers.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in a cluster near the top of
the stem. There are often four or five in full bloom
at once, gathered round a bunch of green buds
which rises in the centre of the cluster. While
the first cluster is in flower, the stem continues to
grow, and by the time these flowers fall off,
another cluster appears at the end of the lengthened
stem, and so on.</p>

<p>If you pull off one of the flower-petals you will
see that the lower half is strap-shaped. But the
petal is much broader at the other end, and it is
round, with a tiny nick in the outer edge.</p>

<p>In the centre there are six stamens whose tips
you can just see where the four petals meet. But
the seed-vessel is hidden until the petals and
sepals and stamens fall off. It then grows into
a thin green pod, and you will find many of these
slender pods standing out from the hairy stem.</p>

<p>Behind the yellow petals are four thin sepals.
When the flower is fully out these lie flat open.
They do not form a cup.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Wild Mustard are dusty
green. They are each in one piece and are broadly
pointed, with the edges cut like the teeth of a saw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. HEDGE MUSTARD</h3>

<p>This is a very common little plant, but it is not
at all attractive. You find it by the roadside
and in waste places in early summer, and it always
looks very dusty.</p>

<p>The flowers are quite small. They grow in little
clusters at the end of a long spike, and there are
usually four or five flowers out at the same time.
These flowers have each four tiny petals of a pale
yellow colour, and unless you look very closely,
and pull these petals gently apart, you will not see
either the stamens or the seed-vessel, which are
almost hidden from sight.</p>

<p>The little green sepals at the back of each
flower stand straight up from the stalk and form
a cup. This cup has slits down the sides and it
holds the flower.</p>

<p>The stalk is almost covered with thin, hairy,
green pods pressed closely against it. These
pods hold the seeds, and they look like green
caterpillars creeping up each side of the stem.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Hedge Mustard are a dull
grey-green colour and are very rough and hairy.
Those nearest the ground have no stalks, they
grow like a rosette, with one leaf close above
another.</p>

<p>But the leaves further up the stem are each
separate. They are very much cut up, and their
edges are toothed like a saw.</p>

3. OPPOSITE-LEAVED GOLDEN SAXIFRAGE</span></div><br>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<h3>1. YELLOW HORNED POPPY</h3>

<p>The Yellow Horned Poppy grows all summer
on sandy seashores or among stones. It is
a showy plant, with large, orange-yellow flowers.</p>

<p>Each flower has four petals which open almost
flat. These petals are very soft and are daintily
waved round the edges.</p>

<p>In the centre of the petals rises a big bunch of
stamens. In the middle of these stamens stands
a curious green horn. This is the seed-vessel, and
it is divided at the tip into three little forks.</p>

<p>As soon as the yellow stamens and the petals
fall off, this horn grows into a long curved pod,
and in this pod are the seeds.</p>

<p>The Horned Poppy has two green sepals which
are very rough and hairy. They cover the flower
so long as it is in bud, but whenever the flower
begins to expand these sepals burst open, and as
soon as the yellow petals have smoothed out their
crinkles in the sun these little green coverings fall
off.</p>

<p>The leaves of this Poppy are thick and leathery,
and are covered with hairs which make them look
grey.</p>

<p>These leaves have no separate stalks, but grow
close to the stem as if they were clasping it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>2. ROCK ROSE</h3>

<p>This is a delicate little branching plant which
trails in summer-time along the ground, on
grassy hills, and among rocks and gravel.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly on short stalks, and
each flower has five bright yellow petals which lie
flat open. These petals are not stiff and glossy
like those of the Buttercup, but soft and easily
crinkled like the Poppy petals.</p>

<p>If you touch very lightly the yellow stamens in
the centre of the flower, they will spread out and
lie down.</p>

<p>The Rock Rose has five little green sepals.
Three of these have their tips slightly tinged with
pink, and these pink-tinged sepals are large enough
to cover the flower when it is in bud. The other two
are much smaller, with sharply-pointed tips, and
they grow at the end of the little flower-stalk
behind the pinky sepals.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Rock Rose are long and narrow
with smooth edges, and they grow opposite each
other on the stem.</p>

<p>These leaves are always dark green above, but
underneath they are covered with fine white woolly
down, and if you hold them up to the light you will
see that the edges are fringed with soft hairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. OPPOSITE-LEAVED GOLDEN SAXIFRAGE</h3>

<p>This small plant grows in damp places by the
side of ditches and on wet rocks. It is
commonest in the north of Britain, but in spring
you will find its soft stems creeping close to the
ground in the south of England also.</p>

<p>The Golden Saxifrage has no petals. The yellow
flowers grow at the end of the stem in small
clusters, which are sunk among the leaves.</p>

<p>Each flower has a yellow calyx tube, which is
divided at the mouth into four parts. These
divisions are yellow inside, but on the outside they
are green.</p>

<p>There is a ring of tiny stamens standing out all
round the mouth of the calyx tube, and in the very
centre of the flower stands a fat seed-vessel, like
a beak, which splits open into halves when the
seeds are ripe.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Golden Saxifrage grow in pairs
on each side of a pale green, juicy stem.</p>

<p>This stem is covered with clear white hairs.
The leaves are pale green and are round in shape,
with crinkled edges. They are very soft, and, like
the stem, they have fine white hairs all over them.</p>

<p>When you gather a handful of the Golden Saxifrage
you find a great many slender white roots
hanging from the stem wherever it has lain along
the ground.</p>

1. COMMON WHIN OR GORSE. 2. BROOM. <br>3. NEEDLE WHIN.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. COMMON WHIN OR GORSE</h3>

<p>This is a shrub children like better to look at
than to gather. It is very common on heaths
and banks and in dry fields, and it blooms in early
summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are curious, because the five petals
are so strangely shaped. One broad petal stands
up highest and is called 'the Standard.' Then
there are two narrow petals at the side; these are
called 'Wings.' And in between these narrow
petals there are two joined together like a tiny
boat, which are called 'the Keel.'</p>

<p>There is a bunch of curved stamens with their
slender stalks all joined together at the bottom
into a green tube.</p>

<p>Amongst these stamens you can see the tip of
the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>When the flower is in bud it is enclosed in a
rough, yellowish-green covering which has many
black hairs all over it. This covering usually
opens in two pieces, and these pieces remain
below the flower until it is withered.</p>

<p>Instead of leaves the Gorse has many sharp
prickly spikes or leaf-thorns. You will notice
that there are many of these sharp spikes which
have little groups of two or three shorter spikes
branching from them, and each branch ends in a
sharp spike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. BROOM</h3>

<p>This is one of our most beautiful spring shrubs.
It grows on heaths and by the roadside, and
sometimes you will see a low hill covered with it,
and glistening like gold in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The flowers are very like those of the Common
Whin, but they are much larger, and the yellow
colour is deeper and more golden.</p>

<p>The petals are shaped the same as in the Common
Whin, and if you look at the green tube into
which the stamens are joined, you will see that it
has a curious green thread at the end which is
twisted into a curl. The seeds are in this tube,
and when the petals and stamens have all fallen
off, this tube becomes a flat green pod tinged
with purple. The curly green thread still remains
at the end.</p>

<p>There are green sepals at the back of the flower
which form a cup. This cup looks as if it was
only in two pieces; but, as in the Common Whin,
it is really made up of five sepals, and you can
often see five little teeth at the mouth which show
where each sepal begins.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Broom are very small, and
they grow in groups of three. Those close to the
flowers have no stalks, but the others have each
a stalk with the three little leaves at the end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. NEEDLE WHIN</h3>

<p>The Needle Whin is not so well known as the
Common Whin or the Broom, though it belongs
to the same family. It is very common, and you
will find plenty of it in spring and early summer
growing close to the ground among the heather.</p>

<p>The flowers are pale yellow, with six petals very
like those of the Common Whin or the Broom,
only much smaller. You find five or six flowers
growing close together on a trailing woody stem.</p>

<p>Each flower sits in a green cup, which is made
up of five sepals joined together. Round the
mouth of the cup are five sharp teeth, and you
can see, much more clearly than in the Common
Whin or in the Broom, where each separate sepal
begins.</p>

<p>After the petals and stamens fall off, the seed-vessels
grow into large, fat pods which are commonly
tinged with purple.</p>

<p>If you are not in the country until the petals
have fallen, you will easily recognise the Needle
Whin by these fat pods. Sometimes five or six
or more grow near the top of each short stem.</p>

<p>The leaves of this tiny Whin are very small and
have scarcely any stalks. Growing up the main
stem are many very fine spines or leaf-thorns, as
sharp as needles.</p>

<p>From these the plant gets its name.</p>

1. ST. JOHN'S WORT. 2. COMMON AVENS. <br>3. TORMENTIL.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. ST. JOHN'S WORT</h3>

<p>This is a tall, handsome plant, whose flowers
appear late in summer among low-growing
bushes or on the hedge-banks.</p>

<p>Each flower has five pale yellow, pointed petals,
which open like a star. On these petals there are
often many small black dots.</p>

<p>The flowers grow on short stalks, which always
rise between a small green leaf and the stem.
These flower-stalks are in pairs, exactly opposite
each other on each side of the stem.</p>

<p>Inside the flower there are a great many
stamens. These stamens are grouped in bunches,
and do not form a ring all round the centre as in
many flowers.</p>

<p>Seated among these bunches is a pear-shaped
seed-vessel with three horns at the top.</p>

<p>At the back of the flower, lying flat open, are
five thin green sepals, whose tips you can see
appearing, as you look down into the flower,
between the yellow petals.</p>

<p>The stalk is smooth and stiff, with two edges
which look as if the sides had been joined together.</p>

<p>The green leaves grow in pairs opposite each
other. They taper to a point and have edges that
are smooth all round. If you look closely you will
see that each leaf is covered with tiny black dots.</p>

<p>There is another St. John's Wort very like this,
but its stalk is square, with four edges.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<br>
<h3>2. COMMON AVENS</h3>

<p>The Common Avens grows abundantly all
summer in woods and on shady hedge-banks,
but it is not very attractive.</p>

<p>The flowers are small, with five separate yellow
petals which lie flat open. As you look down into
the flower, you can see the tips of the five green
sepals appearing between the yellow petals.</p>

<p>Each flower grows at the end of a short stalk,
but two or three of these stalks often spring from
the main stem at the same place.</p>

<p>Half way up this stem you will find a pair of
tiny green leaves with very small buds appearing
between them and the stalk. These buds will
come out later, when their stalks have time to
lengthen.</p>

<p>In the centre of the ring of stamens there is a
small green bunch of seed-vessels. Each seed-vessel
has a thin stiff hair at the top, and
after the yellow petals fall off you will see this
bristly bunch of spikes still at the end of the
flower-stalk, with the tiny green sepals standing
out like a frill behind.</p>

<p>Each leaf is divided into three or more parts.
Those close to the ground are large and coarse,
with the edges cut like the teeth of a saw.</p>

<p>But there are leaves further up the stem, and
these are frequently divided quite differently from
the root leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. TORMENTIL</h3>

<p>This is a dainty little plant which grows all
summer in open woods, and on heaths, where
its masses of small yellow flowers look like gold
stars among the tangle of green leaves and stems.</p>

<p>The flowers are small, with four pale yellow
petals which lie wide open, and rising from
amongst them there are yellow stamens with a
bunch of green seed-vessels in the centre. Behind
these yellow petals there is a green star-circle
of sepals. Four of these sepals are long and
green, and their tips can be seen in front between
the yellow flower-petals.</p>

<p>There are also four much smaller green sepals
which stand between each of the larger ones, so
the calyx is really a beautiful green star with
eight points.</p>

<p>Each flower has a stalk of its own, and each
stalk rises from between a leaf and the stem.
Sometimes they are deeply tinged with purple.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Tormentil are soft and
fine, with a few downy hairs on the front. They
are divided into five fingers, and each of these
fingers has its edges cut into large teeth all the
way round.</p>

<p>Very often these edges turn quite yellow when
the plant is just beginning to fade.</p>

<p>The Tormentil root is rather curious. It looks
like a thick brown finger, but if you cut it, the inside
is a delicate rose red.</p>

1. BIRD'S FOOT TREFOIL. 2. HOP TREFOIL<br>
3. LADY'S FINGERS. 4. MEADOW VETCHLING.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. BIRDSFOOT TREFOIL</h3>

<p>The golden Birdsfoot Trefoil grows nearly
everywhere. You can gather its tufts of
bright yellow flowers all summer in the fields and
woods and waste places.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in heads at the end of a long
flower-stalk, and each head may have from four to
eight flowers close together in a bunch.</p>

<p>The five petals are golden-yellow streaked with
red, and they are strangely shaped. There is one
big petal which stands up behind. Then there are
two long-shaped petals which lie sideways, and
two small ones that are joined together in a
curious point.</p>

<p>After the petals fall off, the seed-vessel in the
centre of the stamens grows into a long, thin
red pod; and when there are four or five of these
narrow pods at the end of the flower-stalk, they
look like the claw of a bird.</p>

<p>That is why this Trefoil is called Birdsfoot.</p>

<p>The leaves are very pretty. There is a single
small green leaflet, with smooth round edges, at
the end of a short stalk. Just below this little
leaflet there is a pair of tiny leaflets. And further
down, where the stalk joins the main stem, you
will find still another little pair. So that the
name Trefoil, which means 'three leaves,' is not
correct, as there are really five small leaflets on
each short stalk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. HOP TREFOIL</h3>

<p>The Hop Trefoil is a cousin of the Birdsfoot
Trefoil, and is quite as plentiful. It grows all
summer by the edge of the fields and in grassy
pastures.</p>

<p>You will easily recognise it by the flowers.
These cluster together in small round yellow
heads like a tiny clover. In each head there
are from twenty to forty little flowers closely
packed together. When you pick one of these
tiny flowers to pieces, you find that the petals
are very much the same as those of the Birdsfoot
Trefoil. But they are so small that you would
require a magnifying glass to see them clearly,
and to discover the stamens and seed-vessels
which are hidden inside.</p>

<p>When the flowers begin to fade, the petals do
not fall off at once, but they shrivel and become
a pale-brown colour. Sometimes you find a flower
of which the lower half is quite brown and withered,
while the upper half remains golden yellow.</p>

<p>At the end of the flower-stalk you find a small
oval green leaflet, and close below this single
leaflet comes a pair of dainty leaflets. On each
stalk there is always this triplet. The main
stem is covered with fine downy hairs, and you
will notice that wherever a leaf-stalk joins this
stem there are two small green sheaths with
points, which look as if they were meant to cover
the join.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. LADY'S FINGERS</h3>

<p>This showy plant grows abundantly all
summer on dry banks and pastures. You
will easily recognise it by the large heads of pale
yellow flowers with their woolly sepals.</p>

<p>The flowers are grouped in two heads at the
end of a stout stalk, and there are usually ten
to twenty separate flowers in each head. The
petals seem very similar to those of the Trefoils,
but each petal ends in a long claw, and these
claws are hidden in the cup formed by the
sepals.</p>

<p>This calyx-cup is edged round the mouth with
sharp teeth, and it is covered with grey fluffy
down. The grey down gives a woolly appearance
to the flowers.</p>

<p>You also find a frill of narrow green pointed
leaves without stalks underneath each head of
flowers.</p>

<p>When the petals and stamens have fallen off,
the yellow calyx-cup becomes much swollen, and
inside it there remains a small pod which bears
the seeds.</p>

<p>On the upper side the leaves are a delicate
blue-green, with fine silky hairs all over them.
But underneath these leaves are much paler.
Each leaflet is long and narrow and is placed
the one opposite the other on the leaf-stalk, at
the end of which there is always a solitary leaflet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>4. MEADOW VETCHLING</h3>

<p>The Meadow Vetchling is not nearly such a
stout plant as the Lady's Fingers. Its stem
is feeble and requires to find support by holding
on to the hedges, or to some other strong plant.</p>

<p>The flowers are a beautiful golden yellow.
They grow in loose bunches near the end of a
straight, stiff flower-stalk. Notice that all the
flowers face one way, and that in each flower the
largest yellow petal is daintily streaked with
purple.</p>

<p>You cannot see either the stamens or the
seed-vessel, which are hidden inside the flower.</p>

<p>The sepals are joined so that they form a green
cup which has five sharp points round the mouth.</p>

<p>The leaflets grow in pairs at the end of the
leaf-stalk. They are long and narrow, like a
lance, with fine lines running from end to end.
In between each pair of leaflets you find a green
twisted thread called a tendril. This tendril curls
round the stem of plants that are stronger than
the Meadow Vetchling, and they support it.</p>

<p>Wherever the leaf-stalk joins the main stem
you will find another pair of green leaves. These
leaves are shaped like the head of an arrow, and
they have a name of their own, which you will
learn when you know more about plants.</p>

1. CREEPING CINQUEFOIL 2. SILVER WEED <br>3. COMMON AGRIMONY</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>1. CREEPING CINQUEFOIL</h3>

<p>This pretty plant is common everywhere. You
will find it all summer by the roadside, in
meadows, and by the edge of the cornfields.</p>

<p>The flowers are bright golden yellow: they
have five petals which open out like a rose, and
in the centre there is a ring of yellow stamens
with a knot of green seed-vessels among them.</p>

<p>In between each of these yellow petals you
see a narrow green point appearing. These are
sepals, and if you look at the back of the flower
you find that the calyx is really a star made up
of ten pointed green sepals.</p>

<p>The flowers grow on long, slender stalks. Both
the flower and the leaves rise from what looks
like another slender stalk creeping close to the
ground. The creeping stalk comes from a root
which resembles a small carrot. This root goes
straight down into the ground, and it sends out
three long, stalk-like creepers which lie along
the surface. Wherever a bunch of leaves and
flowers rises from the creeper, two or three little
white roots go down into the ground. These
take firm hold of the earth and help to keep the
plant steady.</p>

<p>The leaves are beautiful. Each leaf is divided
into five fingers, which are cut round the edges
like the teeth of a saw. They are dark green, and
have long, slender stalks like the flowers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. SILVER WEED</h3>

<p>The Silver Weed prefers to grow in damp
meadows and on the banks of ditches. You
find it in abundance all summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are not unlike those of the
Cinquefoil. They have five golden yellow petals
which are not cup-shaped, but lie flat open.
These petals are larger than those of the
Cinquefoil, and you can only see the smallest tip
of the green sepals appearing in between each.</p>

<p>There are really ten sepals in the calyx. Five
of these are narrow little pointed leaves, but the
others are each divided at the tip. If you remove
all the yellow petals, this green calyx, with its
ten green points, is just like a beautiful star.</p>

<p>The Silver Weed sends out long creepers.
These are thicker than in the Cinquefoil, and are
often tinged with pink.</p>

<p>When the leaves are half-open they look almost
entirely white, because they are covered with a
fine silvery down. But when they are fully out
they become dark green above, and it is only the
underside which remains white and silvery.</p>

<p>Notice that the leaves grow in pairs, with big
leaflets and very little leaflets alternately on each
side of the leaf-stalk, and that their edges are
deeply toothed all round.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. COMMON AGRIMONY</h3>

<p>This plant likes to grow in dry places, such as
hedge-banks or at the side of fields, and it
blooms in summer.</p>

<p>The flowers grow one above the other on a tall
spike, and they look like small yellow stars. Those
that grow lowest down on the spike come out first,
and the small green buds are crowded together
near the top.</p>

<p>In the centre of the five yellow petals there is a
ring of stamens, and amongst those stands a fat,
green seed-vessel with two horns at the top.</p>

<p>The calyx or green covering of the flower is the
part you must notice most closely.</p>

<p>It rises from a short stalk, and is shaped like a
bell. There are ten deep lines running from top
to bottom of this green bell, and round its mouth
there are five large points.</p>

<p>Below these points is a curious ring of tiny hooks
like a fringe, and these cling to whatever touches
them. You often find a dozen of these little green
bells fastened to your skirt if you have been where
the Agrimony grows.</p>

<p>The leaflets are dark and hairy. They grow
opposite each other in pairs, on each side of the
leaf-stalk: first a large pair, then a small pair, turn
about, and you always find a single large leaflet
at the very end.</p>

<p>Each leaflet is deeply cut round the edge and
has teeth like the teeth of a saw.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p><br>

<h3>1. COMMON NIPPLEWORT</h3>

<p>The Nipplewort is very common everywhere.
It grows both in waste places and in cultivated
ground or by the roadside, and you find it in
flower all summer and autumn.</p>

<p>It has a slender round stem, which branches a
good many times, and at the top of each of those
branches you find a tiny yellow daisy. These
daisies are made up of many yellow tubes, each
with a broad yellow strap at the mouth. The
straps have the edges cut into sharp teeth, and
they stand out in a circle all round the small
yellow daisy.</p>

<p>The small yellow heads are held by a green cup
made up of two sets of narrow pointed green leaves,
and you will notice that there is always a single
very tiny grey-green leaf where each branch forks
from the main stem.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Nipplewort vary much in
shape. Some are like a feather of which the lower
part is cut away almost to the centre stalk. Others
are regularly oval, with wavy edges all round, and
these leaves end in a sharp point. They are dark
green in colour, with hairs all round the edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. AUTUMNAL HAWKBIT</h3>

<p>The Hawkweeds are a very large family, and it
will be a long time before you learn to recognise
them all.</p>

<p>The Autumnal Hawkbit is the commonest, and
it is found nearly everywhere, in meadows, in
pastures, and in waste places. It flowers in late
summer and autumn.</p>

<p>The leaves grow in a rosette close to the ground.
They are dark green, rather smooth, and are
shaped like narrow feathers, with the edges irregularly
cut into deep, rounded teeth. They all spring
from the centre root.</p>

<p>The heads of yellow flowers grow on tall,
slender, wiry stalks. Very tiny scale-like green
leaves grow up the stalks at intervals. Each yellow
head is made up of many small yellow tubes with
a strap at the mouth, and these strap tubes are
crowded together all over the flower-head.</p>

<p>When the yellow flowers are withered, the seed-vessels
remain, each with a tuft of feathery cotton
down attached to it But the down ball is not a
perfect one as in the Dandelion; and the down
looks grey.</p>

<p>The top of the flower-stalk is clothed with layers
of narrow pointed green leaves which are tinged
with red, and are sometimes woolly. These layers
are pressed tightly one above the other like the
scales of a fir-cone, and they cover the yellow flower
completely when it is in bud.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. YELLOW GOATSBEARD</h3>

<p>The Yellow Goatsbeard is fairly common in this
country. It grows in meadows and pastures
and in waste places, and it is in flower all summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>It belongs to a large family of plants which are
very difficult to distinguish the one from the other,
and you will find several Goatsbeards that seem
very much alike.</p>

<p>This Goatsbeard is a wiry, straight, slender
plant. The dark green stem is round, and the
leaves grow close to it without stalks. These
leaves are like a broad blade of grass at the
bottom where they join the stem, but near the
top they get very narrow and are folded together,
so that they appear almost round, and they end in
a sharp point.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly on round, smooth
stems. They look like small Yellow Dandelions
with fewer yellow rays, and like the Dandelion they
are made up of many little yellow tubes grouped
together, some of which have yellow straps at the
edge, while others have none. When the flower is
half open you will notice that it stands in a green
cup made up of eight narrow leaves with long,
fine points. These points are much longer than
the yellow rays of the flower, and stand up beyond
them when the flower is closed. The flowers
of the Goatsbeard have the curious habit of closing
at midday, even when the sun is shining.</p>

<br>
<h3>1. COLTSFOOT</h3>

<p>The Coltsfoot is a very common plant. You
find it all over the country, and along with
the Celandine it is one of the first flowers to
appear in spring. The flowers come out before
the leaves. They grow singly at the end of straight,
woolly stalks which have many little pink scale-like
leaves, from top to bottom. When the flowers
are withering, their heads begin to droop; but
when the downy seed-ball is ready to open, the
flower-stalks stand straight up again.</p>

<p>The flowers are bright yellow, and like the Daisy
and Dandelion, which belong to the same family,
they are made up of a great many tiny tubes
grouped close together. Those tubes round the
edge have a long, narrow, yellow strap at the
outside.</p>

<p>After the flowers are withered, the seeds remain
at the end of the stalk, and each seed sends out a
tuft of beautiful, straight, white down which forms
a delicate ball as in the Dandelion. But the Coltsfoot
down-ball is neither so starry nor so beautiful
as that of the Dandelion.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Coltsfoot are entirely covered
with cotton wool when they are small; as they
grow bigger, they become glossy grey-green above,
and are white only underneath.</p>

<p>Each leaf is nearly round, with beautiful pointed
scollops at the edge, and it has a long stalk.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. COMMON GROUNDSEL</h3>

<p>This plant is one of the very commonest we
have. It is in flower all the year round, and
grows everywhere. We have all gathered it to
give to the canaries, who love to pick the tiny
seeds.</p>

<p>The Groundsel flowers grow in small heads of
two or three together at the end of short stalks
which branch at intervals from top to bottom of
the stem. These stalks are not very strong, and
as the flower-heads are heavy, they make the
stalks bend over.</p>

<p>This is another plant whose flowers are composed
of a great many small tubes tightly packed
together. These tubes are yellow, and some have
a broad, short strap at the mouth of the tube, and
in some the mouth is evenly nicked all round.
They grow in a tiny green cup, which is made
up of narrow strap-shaped green leaves tightly
pressed together, and you can only see the tips of
the yellow flowers at the mouth of this cup. After
the flowers are withered, a bunch of white down is
seen coming out of the mouth of the green cup.</p>

<p>The stem of the Groundsel is soft and juicy, and
it has a good many hairs upon it.</p>

<p>The leaves are glossy dark green, and are shaped
like a feather, with large, regular divisions up the
sides. Each division is finely waved all round the
edges.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. COMMON RAGWORT</h3>

<p>The Ragwort is a very common plant. It grows
everywhere, and is in flower in late summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>It is a stout and rather coarse plant, with
bunches of small yellow daisies growing on short
forks which branch from the top of the main stem.</p>

<p>These daisies are rather poor looking, and they
are made up of a great many little flowers crowded
together inside a green cup, and a few of the
flowers round the edge of the cup have yellow
straps which are thin and straggling.</p>

<p>The yellow tube flowers in the centre are evenly
nicked all round the mouth, and they have yellow
stamens whose heads you can see forming a circle
round the yellow tip of the seed-vessel with its two
curled points.</p>

<p>The stems of the Ragwort are sometimes white
and woolly, and they are covered all over with deep
ridges.</p>

<p>The leaves are dark green and shiny. They are
long and feather-shaped, and are deeply cut up
almost to the centre rib, forming narrow green
horns on each side of it.</p>

1. CROSSWORT. 2. BITING STONECROP. <br>3. YELLOW BEDSTRAW. 4. MUGWORT.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. CROSSWORT</h3>

<p>The Crosswort is common in England and in
the South of Scotland, but it does not grow
far North. It is in flower all spring and summer,
and you find it abundantly in woods and thickets.
This is rather a soft, weak plant, which you will
easily recognise by the curious way the leaves are
placed on the stem.</p>

<p>These leaves are small, and pointed, and they
grow in form like a cross. The crosses appear
about an inch apart all the way up the stem, and
their leaves are soft and thin, and are covered all
over with fine hairs.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in clusters on very short stalks
close to the stem where the four leaves meet. They
are yellow and very tiny. Each flower has four
petals, and these petals are joined together and
show four points standing out round the edge.
You will notice four tiny stamens, one of which
lies flat between each of the petals, and there are
also two narrow green leaves springing from
among the small groups of flowers, as well as the
four which form a cross.</p>

<p>The stem of the Crosswort is four-sided, and,
like the leaves, it is covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. BITING STONECROP</h3>

<p>The Biting Stonecrop is common all over
Britain. It is abundant in summer on rocks
and in sandy places by the seaside, and you find
it growing inland too.</p>

<p>The Stonecrop grows in large tufts close to the
ground. It is a small plant with a great many
little branches, and these branches are of two
kinds. Some are thickly covered with fat, juicy
leaves. These leaves are very tiny, and they are
laid thickly all round the stem in the same way
as the scales are laid on a fir-cone. Those leaves
nearest the end of the branch are often tinged
with red.</p>

<p>On the other branches of the Stonecrop the fat
green leaves are not nearly so closely packed
together, and near the end of each branch grow
two or more flowers.</p>

<p>These flowers are golden yellow, and they have
five pointed petals which resemble the rays of a
star, and there are ten yellow stamens lying flat
out, on and between these petals.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower you see five fat little
seed-vessels standing up. After the yellow petals
have all fallen off, these seed-vessels lie down and
show five points like a small green star.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. YELLOW BEDSTRAW</h3>

<p>The Yellow Bedstraw is to be found all over
the country. It grows in pastures, and on
the hedge-banks, and it is in flower all summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>There is a white bedstraw as well as a yellow,
and you will often find great masses of both growing
like a carpet on the grassy hedge-banks. The
stems of the Yellow Bedstraw are not strong,
although they grow to a great length, and the
plant is usually lying in a tangled mass near the
ground.</p>

<p>The flowers are very tiny. They grow in dense
clusters. Each cluster has a short stalk which
branches opposite another stalk on the main stem.
The flowers have four petals and four stamens,
and these stamens have almost no stalks. They
look just like dots lying on the yellow petals.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Yellow Bedstraw are very
tiny. They resemble small green straps, and they
grow in circles, with eight to ten leaves in a circle
round the main stem, close to where the flower
clusters grow. You also find a circle of leaves
growing on the short stalks which hold the
clusters of flowers. These tiny leaves are hairy
underneath.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>4. MUGWORT</h3>

<p>The Mugwort, or Wormwood as it is often
called, is common all over the country. It
grows in waste places and by the borders of the
fields, and it blooms in autumn.</p>

<p>You will easily recognise this plant by its
greeny-white woolly flowers, with their yellow
or red centres. These flowers grow in short
clusters, and each little woolly head is made up of
a number of separate flowers shaped like tubes.
These yellow or red tubes are grouped together
as in the Daisy.</p>

<p>The stem of the Mugwort is pale green, and has
red ridges running from end to end. The leaves
are very handsome. They are large and broad
and feather-shaped, with big leaflets in pairs
opposite each other on the stem, and there is
always a single long leaflet at the end. Each of
these leaflets is deeply cut round the edges into
large teeth.</p>

<p>The back of the Mugwort leaves is covered with
silvery white down, and often the green edges are
curled back on to this white underside.</p>

1. WILD MIGNONETTE 2. COMMON DANDELION <br>3. TANSY</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. WILD MIGNONETTE</h3>

<p>The Wild Mignonette does not grow close to
the ground like the sweet-scented Mignonette
we have in our gardens. It is a tall, spiked plant,
which you find in summer-time on waste ground
and among stone heaps, and it is not at all noticeable.</p>

<p>The flowers grow on short, thin stalks. Those
flowers at the bottom open first, and the little buds
are always at the top of the tall spike.</p>

<p>These flowers are little yellow balls, which seem
to be entirely made up of stamens. But if you
gently pick one of these yellow balls to pieces,
you will find that there are six greenish-yellow
petals.</p>

<p>The four largest petals are so deeply cut round
the edge that they appear to be fringed. But there
are two long thin ones which are each in one piece.
These petals are all joined together at the bottom,
with the bunch of fluffy stamens and the seed-vessel
inside.</p>

<p>Behind this little ball there are six thin green
sepals. These are very narrow and pointed, and
they stand round the flower like the legs of a spider.</p>

<p>The leaves are dark green, and they are very
much lighter underneath than above. They are
very narrow, with crinkled edges, and the upper
half of the leaf branches into three or four parts,
like a stag's horn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. COMMON DANDELION</h3>

<p>The Dandelion is as well known as the Buttercup
and Daisy. It grows in all kinds of
places, and it is in flower from early spring to
late autumn. The large yellow flower-heads are
made up of a great many separate little flower-tubes,
which widen out at the mouth into a long
yellow strap. These yellow tubes are placed on a
round disc with the straps standing out in a circle,
like a rosette. Each flower-head grows singly
at the end of a long green stalk. The stalks are
hollow, and when you break them a white milky
juice oozes out. At the top of the stalk you find
a cup made up of narrow pointed green leaves.
Some of these leaves curve back over the top of
the stalk.</p>

<p>When the yellow flowers are withered, the
round disc is covered with the tiny seed-vessels.
Each seed-vessel ends in a slender green spike
which has a beautiful tuft of starry down at its
tip. This ball of starry down is one of the most
beautiful things in the flower world.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Dandelion are a smooth
glossy green. They are shaped like a blunt arrow-head,
and they have a white line running up the
centre. The edges are cut up into huge teeth
which are said to resemble the teeth of a lion.
From this the plant gets its name.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. TANSY</h3>

<p>The Tansy is to be found in hedge-banks, and
by the roadside, or on the borders of the
fields in many places all over the country, though
in the North it is not very common. It flowers
in autumn, and is a tall, bushy plant, with large
green, ferny leaves.</p>

<p>The Tansy has a short, green stem rising stiff
and straight from the ground, and this stem
branches at the top into three or four forks. Each
of these forks divides again into two or three
smaller forks, and there is a flower which looks
like a yellow button at the end of each fork.</p>

<p>If you pick one of these yellow buttons to pieces
you find that it is made up of a great many
yellow tubes, with a swollen green part at the
bottom. These yellow tubes are of two kinds.
In some the mouth of the tube is cut evenly all
round into small scollops, and in others there is
a yellow strap at one side of the tube. These
tubes stand on a round disc, and at the back of
this disc there is a thick double row of small
green pointed leaves, which form a green cup
behind the yellow buttons.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Tansy are like coarse ferns.
They are feather-shaped, with deeply cut divisions,
and each division is toothed at the edges. The
Tansy has a strong scent, especially when you
crush its leaves or stalks.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. PRIMROSE</h3>

<p>Is there any child who does not know the
Primrose? In spring and early summer you
will find its yellow blossom starring the woods
and hedge-banks, and you will see it too by the
seashore.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly on fine stalks rising
from the middle of the root. A long yellow tube
is hidden in the deep calyx-cup, and the mouth
of this tube opens out into five pale lemon-yellow
petals. Each petal has a notch in the outer edge,
and there are two orange-coloured streaks running
from the base. In the centre of the petals, you
can see the mouth of the tube with the heads
of the stamens in its throat. The slender thread
with its pinhead top, which rises from the seed-vessel,
can just be seen. Yet you will also find
Primroses where the heads of the stamens are
hidden from sight, but where this seed-vessel
thread reaches beyond the mouth of the tube.</p>

<p>The calyx-cup is pale-green and hairy, and has
fine, sharp teeth round the edge.</p>

<p>The Primrose leaves grow in a rosette, rising
with short, juicy stalks from the root. They are
covered with a fine network of veins, which are
much raised on the underside of the leaf. The
leaf is crinkled all over.</p>

<p>Before the leaves are full grown, the edges are
often rolled back so as nearly to meet on the
silvery underside.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. COWSLIP</h3>

<p>The Cowslip is the Queen of our meadow
flowers. It is common in England and
Ireland, and in many parts of Scotland. The
spring, or early summer, is the best time to
find it.</p>

<p>The flowers grow, a dozen or more together,
in a loose cluster, at the end of a stout, round
stalk. Each flower has a yellow tube which is
sunk out of sight in a swollen calyx-cup. This
cup is a beautiful light green colour, with five
sharp teeth at the mouth, and it is covered with
soft hairs. Sometimes you find it tinged with
brown streaks.</p>

<p>Round the mouth of the yellow flower-tube
stand five small lemon-coloured petals, each with
a V-shaped nick in the outer edge, and a bright,
reddish-orange spot at the base. If you look at
the back of a cowslip, you will see that the yellow
tube is swollen just below the petals.</p>

<p>There are five stamens, whose heads are just
visible in the throat of the tube, with the tip of
the seed-vessel amongst them. In some flowers
this slender pillar comes a good way beyond the
mouth of the tube, and the stamens are hidden
out of sight.</p>

<p>The Cowslip leaves are crinkled all over, and
have swollen veins which are much raised on
the underside. In the young leaves the edges
are rolled very far back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. BOG ASPHODEL</h3>

<p>This wiry little plant is fond of marshy places
and wet bogs and heaths. It grows all over
the country, and is in flower in late summer and
autumn.</p>

<p>The Bog Asphodel has a tall, wiry flower-stalk,
near the top of which you find a spike of orange-yellow
flowers. There are three narrow-pointed
orange petals, and three orange sepals; but these
are so much alike, you will not be able to distinguish
between them. When the flower is in full
bloom, these petals and sepals open out, like the
rays of a star; then when the seeds are ripening,
they close and form an orange cup.</p>

<p>In the centre of the star there are six stamens,
with woolly yellow stalks and bright red heads.
There is also a small pear-shaped green seed-vessel.</p>

<p>Each flower has its own short stalk. Notice the
tiny green leaves which grow at intervals on the
wiry flower-stalk, tightly pressed against it.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Bog Asphodel are like coarse
grass. They have no stalks, and look as if they
had been slightly folded together from end to end.
Each leaf has long lines running from base to tip.</p>

1. HONEYSUCKLE 2. YELLOW WATER IRIS <br>3. DAFFODIL</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. HONEYSUCKLE</h3>

<p>The Honeysuckle grows in all parts of the
country. You will find its sweet-scented
flowers in thickets and woods during summer
and autumn. It is a shrub with long, feeble, woody
stems. These stems twist themselves round young
trees and hedges, which support the plant and raise
it up towards the sun.</p>

<p>The Honeysuckle flowers grow in loose heads at
the end of the leaf-stem. They are shaped like
long trumpets, and these trumpets are very narrow
at the one end, and widen out at the mouth into
two unequal lips. The lower lip is merely a long
strap curled over at the end. But the upper lip is
very much broader, and it is fringed at the edge.
These beautiful flower-trumpets are yellow-pink,
sometimes almost purple on the outside, and inside
they are pale yellow. There are often seven to ten
of these trumpets close together in one cluster, and
you can see the heads of the stamens, and the long
green tip of the seed-vessel coming out of the
mouth of each trumpet.</p>

<p>After the flowers are withered, the seeds grow
into clear dark crimson berries, of which the birds
are very fond.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Honeysuckle grow opposite
each other in pairs. They are blue-green in colour,
are very smooth, and have a network of tiny veins
all over them. Each leaf is oval, and its edges are
smooth all the way round.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. YELLOW WATER IRIS</h3>

<p>The Yellow Iris with its lily flowers and sword-like
leaves is found in summer-time by the
side of ditches, and marshes, and ponds.</p>

<p>In the Iris the petals and the sepals are almost
the same colour. The flower has a short yellow
tube which folds back at the mouth into three
broad, handsome yellow sepals, beautifully marked
with deep orange streaks.</p>

<p>Between each of these sepals stands a small pale
yellow petal.</p>

<p>Rising from the centre of the flower are what
look like other three pale yellow petals, with
fringed ends which curl upward. These are really
three branches of the slender column which rises
from the seed-vessel, and they bend backwards
over each sepal. Half hidden under each of these
fringed petals, you can see the dark purple head
of a stamen, closely pressed against the broad
yellow sepal.</p>

<p>The yellow flower-tube stands above the seed-vessel.
This seed-vessel becomes very large in
autumn, and it bursts lengthways into three parts,
showing rows of dark brown seeds tightly packed
together inside.</p>

<p>Before the flower opens, the Iris is enclosed in a
green sheath.</p>

<p>The leaves are sword-shaped, with long lines
running from base to tip. They are smooth, and
in colour they are a dim green.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. DAFFODIL</h3>

<p>The Daffodil is one of our loveliest spring
flowers. It is found abundantly in woods,
and in meadows and pastures in England, but in
Scotland it does not grow wild, and it is doubtful
whether it really does so in Ireland.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly on tall stalks. Each
Daffodil is enclosed in a light brown sheath, which
stands erect. But when the growing flowers have
burst this covering, they droop their heads.</p>

<p>Each flower has a short yellow tube, divided
about half way down into six deep points.</p>

<p>These points do not fold back, they enclose a
long yellow trumpet, which is beautifully scolloped
round the mouth.</p>

<p>Inside this trumpet are six stamens with large
yellow heads, and the slender stalks of these
stamens cling to the sides of the yellow trumpet.
There is also a short pillar rising from the fat
green seed-vessel, which you can see outside the
coloured petals, below the yellow tube.</p>

<p>In the Daffodil, the sepals and petals are the
same colour.</p>

<p>The stalk of the Daffodil is slightly twisted, and
has fine lines running up it. It rises straight from
the centre of the bulb which forms the root.</p>

<p>The leaves are long, narrow straps with blunt
points, and they are thick and juicy.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>3. COMMON COMFREY</h3>

<p>This tall, harsh-leaved plant is to be found all
over the country in moist places, by the sides
of streams and ditches, and by the roadside. It
blooms in spring and autumn.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Common Comfrey are not
always the same colour. Sometimes you find
them pale yellow, and in other places they are a
rich purple, and the buds are pink. These flowers
grow in drooping clusters on short little stalks
which curve in a curious serpent manner before
the buds open.</p>

<p>The five petals joined together form a bell, which
is cut into deep teeth at the edge. Within this
bell, there are five stamens clinging to the sides,
and from the seed-vessel, a long, slender white
thread rises. You can see this white thread best
after the yellow bell is withered, and the seed-vessel
is left sitting in the centre of the calyx.
The green calyx-cup is very shallow, with fine,
sharply pointed teeth round the mouth.</p>

<p>The stem of the Comfrey is covered with hard,
rough hairs. It has ridges running from top to
bottom, and it is hollow in the middle. The leaves
on the stem grow in tufts of three or four, without
any stalks. They are narrow and pointed, with
wavy edges, and are covered with hairs.</p>

<p>Many other coarse leaves rise from the root.
These leaves, too, have no stalks, and they are
broad and hairy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. SNEEZEWORT YARROW</h3>

<p>This sturdy flower is the parent of the snow-white
Bachelor's Buttons, which grow in our
garden: it is a cousin of the Millfoil or Yarrow.
It is common all over the country, where you find
it in meadows and ditches, and by the roadside.
It blooms in autumn.</p>

<p>The flowers resemble small daisies. You find
about a dozen growing together on short stalks,
near the top of the main stem.</p>

<p>Each daisy consists of a disc which is closely
covered with greenish-white tube-flowers. The
mouth of these tube-flowers is cut into points
which bend outward, and coming out of the centre
of each tube, you can see the yellow tip of the
seed-vessel, round which the heads of the stamens
are placed edge to edge like a deep collar.</p>

<p>Round the outer edge of the disc there is a
small circle of tube-flowers, each of which has a
broad white strap, and these straps are nicked at
the ends.</p>

<p>Underneath these small daisies stands a circle
of tiny green pointed leaves; these form a cup
which protects the plant when it is in bud.</p>

<p>The stem of the Sneezewort is very sturdy.
The leaves are sword-shaped, with long veins
running from the base to the tip. They clasp the
stem, and all round the edge they are cut into
very fine teeth, like a saw.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. MOUNTAIN EVERLASTING</h3>

<p>This woolly little plant is common over most
of the north country, on heaths and sandy
pastures and in upland districts; but you do not
find it in the south of England. It is in flower all
summer.</p>

<p>The root of the Mountain Everlasting is like a
thin brown worm lying on the surface of the
ground, and from this root, long, slender brown
threads go down into the ground and keep the
flower steady.</p>

<p>The flowers resemble small woolly daisies.
They grow in clusters of four or more, at the end
of the main stem, and each cluster has a short,
stiff stalk of its own.</p>

<p>These woolly daisies are made up of a great
many tiny pink flower-tubes, each with a ring of
fine white hairs round it. These tubes are surrounded
by a double row of woolly, downy leaves
which stand out like the strap-shaped rays of the
daisy.</p>

<p>Underneath these woolly rays is a green cup,
made up of a double row of narrow strap-shaped
brown or green leaves, pressed close together.</p>

<p>The main stem rises straight and firm from the
creeping root. It is closely covered with white
down, and at intervals it is clasped by narrow,
pointed green leaves. These leaves are dark
green on the upper side, but underneath they are
covered with white woolly down.</p>

<h3>1. TRAVELLER'S JOY</h3>

<p>You will have no difficulty in recognising this
plant. It has masses of grey-green flowers,
and big bunches of feathery tufts; and you will
find it growing in summer right over the tops of
the hedges.</p>

<p>There are some unusual things about this flower.
It has really no petals. There are four pretty
sepals of a grey-green colour, which are covered
with soft white woolly down. These woolly sepals
soon fall off, and within you find a big bunch of
whitish green stamens. When the seeds which
grow in the centre of the bunch of stamens begin
to ripen, they each send out a long feathery tail.
These tails wave in the air, and look like tufts of
down clinging to the hedges.</p>

<p>The leaves are dark green above and paler green
below. They grow opposite each other on the
stem. Sometimes their edges are quite smooth,
and sometimes they are cut like the teeth of a big
saw.</p>

<p>The stem of the Traveller's Joy is very tough
and woody. It is easily bent, and would not be
able to rise from the ground were it not that there
are little curly green threads called tendrils below
the small leaves. These tendrils twist themselves
round the stems of the hedges, and with this
support the plant can climb as high as the top of
the hedge.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. WOOD ANEMONE</h3>

<p>This is one of the daintiest of our wild plants.
You find the woods carpeted with it in early
spring.</p>

<p>The flower has six delicate white sepals. These
are long and rather narrow, and on the outside
they are often tinged with purple or pink. The
buds are usually quite pink until they open. These
pink sepals form the calyx. There are no petals.</p>

<p>Within the pink sepals are many stamens with
little yellow heads set on stems as fine as a hair,
and in the centre of these stamens there is a small
green knot of seeds.</p>

<p>The Wood Anemone has two kinds of green
leaves. The flower grows on a short, smooth
stalk, which rises from the centre of three soft,
dark green leaves. These leaves are each divided
into three parts, which are deeply cut up round
the edge, and their short stalks are covered with
fine hairs.</p>

<p>The second leaves rise on slender stalks straight
from the root. They are divided very much the
same as the others. If you dig up the Wood
Anemone root you find that it is like a rough
brown bit of stick. It creeps along underneath
the ground instead of going straight down into
it, and you can see that the flower and the first
set of three leaves rises at a different part from
the stalk which bears the other leaves.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. WATER CROWFOOT</h3>

<p>The Water Crowfoot is really a white Buttercup,
and it likes to grow in ponds or in
rivers that run very slowly. The flowers are at
their best in May and June.</p>

<p>These flowers have five glossy white petals,
and each petal has a yellow patch at the foot.
Behind these beautiful white petals there are five
green sepals which fold back close round the
flower-stalk.</p>

<p>Within the flower there are stamens with thick
yellow heads, growing in a circle round a small
green knot which holds the seed-vessels.</p>

<p>This Water Crowfoot has two kinds of leaves.
Some grow underneath the water, and these
leaves are divided into fine hairs, which are each
forked at the end. The water runs very easily
through these hairs.</p>

<p>But those leaves which are above the water are
solid. They are dark green and glossy, and are
nearly round. Each leaf is divided into three
parts, and sometimes the edges are cut up, and
often they are quite smooth.</p>

<p>You may sometimes find a leaf with one-half
made up of hairy threads while the other half is
solid.</p>

1. SHEPHERD'S PURSE 2. COMMON SCURVY GRASS <br>3. HAIRY ROCK CRESS</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. SHEPHERD'S PURSE</h3>

<p>The Shepherd's Purse is a very common plant,
and it is not at all attractive. It is found all
summer by the roadside and in waste places.</p>

<p>The flowers grow close together on short stalks
near the top of a spike. They are very small, with
tiny white petals, and those flowers which grow
lowest on the spike always come out first. The
buds are in a cluster at the very tip of the spike.</p>

<p>After the flower is withered, the seed-vessel,
which still clings to the end of the short stalk,
begins to swell. It looks like a small green
heart, with a hard knot in the centre. You will
easily recognise the Shepherd's Purse by these
seed-vessels, which are far more noticeable than
the tiny white flowers.</p>

<p>This plant has two kinds of leaves. Those that
grow close to the ground have short stalks, and
they spring from the root in the form of a rosette.
Each leaf is long and narrow, and the edges are
deeply cut up, nearly to the centre vein of the leaf.</p>

<p>But the Shepherd's Purse has other leaves
which grow further up the flower-stem. These
are shaped like the head of an arrow, and at the
bottom they clasp the stem closely.</p>

<p>Both kinds of leaves are usually hairy all over,
and so are the stalks, but sometimes you find
plants where they are quite smooth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. COMMON SCURVY GRASS</h3>

<p>The Common Scurvy Grass likes to grow on
muddy shores and on rocks by the seaside,
where you will find its masses of white flowers
all summer.</p>

<p>The flowers grow close together in a cluster on
short stalks. Each flower has four white petals,
which are sometimes tinged with purple. The
four tiny sepals are tinged with purple too. And
the buds which are crowded together at the end
of the cluster are nearly all purple.</p>

<p>After the flowers are withered, the seed-vessels
still cling to the end of the flower-stalks. In
this plant the seed-vessels are round, like small
berries, and they are greenish-brown in colour.
You usually find eight or ten of these berries halfway
up the stem; then there will be several white
flowers still in full bloom, and at the top of the
stem comes a cluster of purple buds.</p>

<p>The Common Scurvy Grass has two kinds of
leaves. Those that spring directly from the root
have long stalks. They are broad, with smooth
edges, which are slightly waved, and they are
thick and fleshy. The second kind of leaves has
no stalks; they grow clasping the stem closely,
and they are shaped like arrow-heads.</p>

<p>The stem of the plant is hollow, and four-sided.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>3. HAIRY ROCK CRESS</h3>

<p>This dusty-looking plant grows on dry places
such as rocks, or on the top of old walls or
on hedge-banks.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Hairy Rock Cress are white
and very tiny. They have four petals, which are
not at all attractive, and they grow on each side of
a tall spike. After the flowers are withered, the
seed-vessel, which is in the middle of each flower,
grows into a long thin pod like a needle. The
green needle remains at the end of the flower-stalk,
and you will see ever so many of these
slender green pods standing straight up round
the flower-spike.</p>

<p>You will easily recognise this plant by these
green needle pods.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Hairy Rock Cress are very
rough, and have coarse hairs all over them. Some
are long and narrow, and cling closely to the stem.
Others are broader, and they have short stalks
and wavy edges. Those leaves which have stalks
usually grow close to the ground at the foot of the
main stem.</p>

1. COMMON CHICKWEED 2. MOUSE-EARED CHICKWEED <br>3. GREATER STITCHWORT</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. COMMON CHICKWEED</h3>

<p>The Common Chickweed is found all over the
country. It grows in fields, in waste ground,
and on hedge-banks, and it is in flower from spring
till autumn.</p>

<p>The Chickweed is a feeble, straggling plant, and
it grows in an untidy mass near the ground. It is
one of those plants that look very different in
different places. It does not thrive well in dry,
stony ground, where it looks small and dried up.
But in untidy gardens where there is good soil
you will find it in large bunches, with many white
flowers and good-sized leaves. The canary birds
like it best when there are many white flowers and
seeds.</p>

<p>The white flowers are small, with tiny strap-shaped
petals, and there are five small, green
sepals with sharp points which show like the rays
of a green star behind these tiny white petals.</p>

<p>Each flower grows at the end of a stalk which
rises between the leaf and the main stem. The
Chickweed leaves are oval, with smooth edges, and
they grow in pairs up the stem. If you look closely
at this stem you will see a line of fine hairs running
down one side, and if you break this stem in two
you will find that there is a green thread inside,
which is more difficult to break than its soft
green covering.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. MOUSE-EARED CHICKWEED</h3>

<p>The Mouse-eared Chickweed is very common
all over the country. It grows in dry places,
on old walls or on sandy ground, and it is in flower
all summer.</p>

<p>It is a much smaller plant than the Common
Chickweed. The white flowers are very tiny, and
most of them grow in clusters at the end of short
stalks which branch from the main stem. But you
will also find a single flower appearing between the
green leaves which grow in pairs at intervals up
the main stem.</p>

<p>These leaves are very hairy. Sometimes they
are sticky, and the whole plant is usually covered
with dust, and is not at all attractive.</p>

<p>The Mouse-eared Chickweed is not such a
feeble, straggling plant as the Common Chickweed.
Its stems are stronger, and they rise
straight from the ground without requiring support.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. GREATER STITCHWORT</h3>

<p>You will find the Greater Stitchwort in many
places. It grows in grassy meadows, in
woods and in thickets, and also on rocks among
the mountains; and it blooms in spring or early
summer.</p>

<p>The Stitchwort is a tall, slender plant, and the
flowers are large and very pretty. They grow
singly at the end of short stalks, which usually
branch in pairs again and again from the main
stem, oftenest where two leaves join. These
flowers have five snowy white petals, each of
which has a deep notch cut in the outer edge, and
there are delicate green veins all over the petals.
Within the flower there are ten yellow-headed
stamens. Some of these stamens are long, and
some are quite short; and in the middle there is a
fat green seed-vessel.</p>

<p>Behind these beautiful white petals grow five
narrow pointed sepals, which have very little
colour. These sepals are like tiny scales, slightly
tinged with green, and they lie flat behind the
white flower.</p>

<p>The stem of the Greater Stitchwort is not very
strong, and it has always a line of hard, short
bristles, running up each side. The leaves are
like blades of grass, narrow and pointed, but they
are harder than grass, and the edges curl backwards.
On these edges are hard bristles, the same
as those on the stems.</p>

1. GOUTWEED. 2. WILD ANGELICA
<br>3. YELLOW BEDSTRAW. 4. HEMLOCK WATER DROPWORT.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. GOUTWEED</h3>

<p>This plant grows in all parts of Britain. You
find it among old ruins, and by the roadside
on damp hedge-banks. It blooms in summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are white and very small. They
grow in clusters at the end of long green spokes,
like the ribs of an umbrella, and you will notice
that there are no little green pointed leaves either
at the back of the separate flower clusters, or at
the top of the stem where all the green spokes
join.</p>

<p>The seed-vessels are almond-shaped, with little
hollows running from top to bottom, and they have
two long green hairs hanging out at the top.</p>

<p>The stalk of the Goutweed is hollow. It is very
glossy and smooth, and has many ridges.</p>

<p>The leaves are shaped rather like rose leaves.
They are pale green and are softer than rose
leaves, and there is only one other plant with
umbrella spokes whose leaves are at all similar.
They are quite different from the fern-like leaves
of so many other umbrella plants.</p>

<p>Notice the broad sheath where each leaf joins
the main stem.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. WILD ANGELICA</h3>

<p>This bushy plant is common all over Britain.
It flowers in summer and autumn, and it
likes to grow in damp places, especially beside
streams. At first you might mistake the Wild
Angelica for Goutweed, as the leaves are very
similar, but there are several differences. The
Wild Angelica flowers are small and white, sometimes
they are tinged with lilac, and they grow in
clusters at the end of green spokes like the ribs
of an umbrella.</p>

<p>At the back of each cluster of flowers you will
find three tiny pointed green leaves, and at the
top of the stem where all the spokes join there
are other three. This is the first difference.</p>

<p>The seeds of the Wild Angelica are quite a
different shape from the Goutweed seeds. They
are much broader, with rough ridges running up
them, and they have no bristles standing up at the
top. This is the second point to notice.</p>

<p>The Wild Angelica stalk is beautifully tinged
with rich purple, not in spots as in the Common
Hemlock, but all over; and it is smooth, with fine
lines running up and down. This is a third point.</p>

<p>And lastly, the leaves grow from the end of a
curious large round sheath. This sheath is pale
green and is very smooth and silky. It clasps the
stem, which seems to grow right through the
middle of it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. UPRIGHT HEDGE PARSLEY</h3>

<p>In summer you will find the Upright Hedge
Parsley all over the country, on hedge-banks
and in waste places.</p>

<p>The tiny flowers are white, and are very often
tinged with pink. They grow in clusters on green
spokes which rise from the end of the main stem
like the ribs of an umbrella. These green spokes
are rough and hairy, and you will recognise this
plant by these rough spokes.</p>

<p>There is a ring of narrow pointed green leaves
at the top of the main stem where all the spokes
join, and there are also little leaves at the back of
each cluster of flowers.</p>

<p>In the Upright Hedge Parsley the seed-vessels
are different from those of any of the other umbrella
plants in this book. They are a dark pinky
purple in colour, and are covered with short, thick
bristles. At the top of each seed-vessel there are
two long, thin bristles which bend over, very much
like those in the Goutweed. You will always be
able to recognise this plant by these bristly, purple
seed-vessels.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Upright Hedge Parsley are
dark green and hairy. They are like ferns, and
have many divisions, which are cut into teeth all
round the edge.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>4. HEMLOCK WATER DROPWORT</h3>

<p>This is one of the most poisonous plants that
grow in Britain. A great many accidents
have been caused by cattle and human beings
eating its leaves and roots.</p>

<p>The Hemlock Water Dropwort is common all
over the country, and it is in flower most of the
summer.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in large clusters at the end of
green spokes. They are white, and they have each
five stamens with large pink heads, so that from
a distance the clusters look pink. There are little
pointed green leaves at the back of the flower
clusters as well as where the spokes join the main
stem.</p>

<p>The seed-vessels of the Hemlock Water Dropwort
are a light brown colour, with slight ridges,
and they have two little points standing up at the
top. You will know this plant by these seed-vessels
and by the curious roots.</p>

<p>The stems are tall and straight, with grooves
running from top to bottom. They are hollow, and
so tough that they are very difficult to gather. The
roots are shaped like the fingers of your hand,
long, fleshy fibres that grow very thick. These
poisonous roots have sometimes been mistaken
for Water Parsnips. The leaves are dark green
and glossy. They are not fern-like, as are those
of so many of the other umbrella plants.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. COW PARSNIP</h3>

<p>The Cow Parsnip is a common plant which you
find all over Britain in summer and autumn.</p>

<p>It is one of a large family of plants which have
from eight to twenty stiff green spokes at the end
of the stem. These spokes are all about the same
length, and they stand up like the ribs of an umbrella.
In late autumn, when the flowers are
withered, the brown ribs still remain on the plant.</p>

<p>Each green rib carries a flat bouquet of flowers.
In the centre of this bouquet there are green
buds, and all round the buds is a ring of small
white flowers.</p>

<p>The stem of the plant is rough and hairy, and it
is deeply grooved. The inside is hollow, and when
the winter comes, small insects creep into these
hollow stems for shelter.</p>

<p>The Cow Parsnip has large, rough leaves.
These are covered with coarse hairs, and they
always look dusty and shabby. You will notice
curious green knobs which appear close to the
stem.</p>

<p>These knobs are covered with a thin green
sheath, and the flower-bud, with all its spokes
still closed, is inside.</p>

<p>This bud grows bigger and bigger until it bursts
the sheath. Then the flowers unfold, leaving the
green covering still growing from the stem, with a
curious green leaf coming out of the end.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. WILD CHERVIL</h3>

<p>This is a slender plant which is very common
on hedge-banks and in open woods. It blooms
all spring and summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are white, and they grow in clusters
at the end of green spokes which look like the
ribs of an umbrella. Notice that there is no ring
of feathery green leaves where these spokes join
the main stem. Before the flowers open, these
green spokes bend downward.</p>

<p>There is a ring of tiny pointed leaves at the back
of each cluster of flowers. These tiny leaves are
tinged with pink, and when the flowers are fully
opened, they fold back close to the main stem.</p>

<p>In the centre of each flower there is a long, thin
seed-vessel. After all the white petals have
fallen off, these seed-vessels grow into fat green
beaks, each on a short stalk, and with two green
points at the end.</p>

<p>The Wild Chervil is easily recognised by these
clusters of green beak-like seed-vessels.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Wild Chervil are pale green,
with fern-like divisions. Wherever they join the
main stem there is a broad sheath.</p>

<p>The Wild Chervil has a stem which is deeply
grooved. This stem is not spotted, but you will
find another Chervil, the Rough Chervil, which is
very like this one.</p>

<p>In it the stem is covered with purple blotches,
and the leaves are blunter and less fern-like.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. SEA CARROT</h3>

<p>The Sea Carrot is common in many parts of
Britain, where it blooms on the seashore all
summer and autumn.</p>

<p>It belongs to the large family of plants that
carry their flowers on green spokes like the ribs
of an umbrella, and as these flowers are very confusing,
you must notice the differences carefully.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Sea Carrot are usually small
and white, though sometimes they have a pinky
tinge. They grow in masses at the end of the
green spokes. Before the flowers are fully out,
these spokes stand straight up in the air, very
close together, with the clusters of flower-buds
all turned inwards.</p>

<p>But when the buds begin to open, these green
spokes fold down so as to give the flowers room
to look up towards the sun.</p>

<p>You will always know the Sea Carrot by the
curious way the spokes stand close together until
the flowers open.</p>

<p>At the top of the main stem, where all the
spokes join, there is a circle of feathery green
leaves. These feathery leaves each end in three
points, and they have a special name which you
will learn some day.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Sea Carrot are like fine soft
ferns. They are so pretty that people use them
for decoration among flowers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>4. COMMON HEMLOCK</h3>

<p>The Hemlock is a common plant which is found
all summer in waste places by the roadside
and in open woods. It is poisonous, and you should
look at it carefully, so as to know and avoid it.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in clusters at the end of green
spokes like the ribs of an umbrella, which do not
droop before they are fully out.</p>

<p>At the back of each little cluster of flowers you
find three tiny pointed green leaves which are
all turned to one side. This is the first point by
which to recognise the Common Hemlock.</p>

<p>The stem is covered with purple blotches, and
there is only one other umbrella plant which has a
spotted stem.</p>

<p>The Common Hemlock stem is not hairy. It is
smooth, with green ridges running up it, and it is
not swollen where the leaves branch from it. This
is the second point to notice.</p>

<p>The third point, and a very important one, is
the shape of the seed-vessels. In the Wild
Chervil these are little green beaks, rather long
and thin, standing up in clusters. But in the
Common Hemlock the seed-vessels are short and
round; they are like two small apples stuck close
together, and each has a little green swelling at
the top. These seed-vessels are covered all over
with rough ridges.</p>

<p>The leaves are fern-like, and resemble many of
the other umbrella plants.</p>

1. MEADOW SWEET.  2. WILD STRAWBERRY. <br>3. WOOD SORREL.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. MEADOW SWEET</h3>

<p>The Meadow Sweet grows abundantly all
summer by the side of streams and in damp
places. Many a time its delightful scent has
tempted us to gather it in handfuls.</p>

<p>The flowers are creamy white, and are very
small, with a great many yellow stamens in the
centre. They grow in large clusters on short
branching stalks, and the buds look like tiny
ivory balls set in small green cups. You often
see two or more branched stalks which shoot
high above the mass of open flowers, bearing a
great many closed buds. When the flowers are
withered, the five green sepals fold back against
the stem.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Meadow Sweet are
dark and rough above, but underneath they are
covered with white down. They have a central
leaf-stalk, and on each side of the stalk grow a
pair of big leaflets and a pair of small leaflets
alternately. Sometimes two pairs of very small
leaflets may come together, and at the end of the
stalk you always find one big leaflet which has
several points.</p>

<p>The stem of this plant is hard, and it has lines
running from end to end. Where the flower-stalk
and the leaf-stalk join this stem, you find a curious
green sheath, which seems to clasp them all
together, and this sheath has sharply cut edges.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. WILD STRAWBERRY</h3>

<p>The Wild Strawberry is common all over
Britain. In early summer you find it in woods
and on shady hedge-banks. This pretty plant is
related to the Wild Rose. It has dainty little
flowers, with five small white petals, and behind
these petals is a star of ten green pointed sepals.
Five of these sepals have large points which show
in between the white petals as you look down into
the flowers, and the five which are smaller you can
only see at the back of the flower.</p>

<p>The stamens grow in a ring close round the
seed-vessel, and as they are joined to the sepals,
they do not fall off when the white petals wither.</p>

<p>As the fruit ripens, the seed-vessel swells into
a bright red berry, and you can see the tiny yellow
seeds clinging all over this juicy berry.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Wild Strawberry are
beautiful. They are dark and crinkled, with soft
hairs on the edges, and these edges are cut into
large teeth. There are always three leaflets at
the end of each stalk.</p>

<p>This Strawberry plant sends out long green
shoots which lie close to the ground. Wherever
a tuft of leaves rises from one of these shoots, a
little bunch of white roots grows down into the
ground, and these help to keep the plant steady.</p>

<br>
<h3>3. WOOD SORREL</h3>

<p>The dainty Wood Sorrel is common all over the
country. It grows in damp woods and in
shady places, and it blooms in spring.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly at the end of slender
pink stalks. They are large, and have five beautiful
white petals, slightly tinged with pink. These
petals are covered all over with fine veins, and
when the sun shines on the plant they open out
almost flat.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the bundle of yellow
stamens in the centre of the flower, you will find
that five are long and five are short.</p>

<p>Behind the white petals there is a tiny green
cup, which is made up of five sepals joined together.
The mouth of this cup is edged with five
sharp points.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Wood Sorrel are very pretty.
Each leaf has a slender pink stalk which springs
straight from the root, and every leaf is divided
into three delicate leaflets, which are pale green
above, and a delicate pale pink below. These
leaflets are heart-shaped, and before they have fully
opened, they droop close to the stem.</p>

<p>If you taste one of the Wood Sorrel leaves, you
will find it is bitter but not unpleasant.</p>

1. GOOSEGRASS OR CLEAVERS 2. WOODRUFF <br>3. YARROW OR MILLFOIL</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. GOOSEGRASS OR CLEAVERS</h3>

<p>This clinging plant is common everywhere. It
grows abundantly on every hedge-bank, and
it is in bloom all summer and autumn.</p>

<p>The flowers are so small that you scarcely
notice them. Each flower has four tiny white
petals, and four yellow-headed stamens. Behind
the flower there is a ring of narrow pointed pale
green leaves.</p>

<p>When the white petals fall off, you see two pale
olive or dull purple seeds, shaped like little balls.
These balls always grow in pairs, and they are
covered with sharp, prickly hooks, which cling
to everything they touch. You find them clinging
to your clothes, and they get caught in the hair
of a dog's back, and you see them sticking to the
wool of the sheep who nibble at the hedge-banks.</p>

<p>The square stem of the Goosegrass is rather
weak. It, too, has hooks on its four sides, and
these hooks catch hold of stronger plants in the
hedge-bank, and so help the Goosegrass to rise
well above the ground.</p>

<p>The leaves are long and narrow, and they have
little hooks along the edge. They grow in a
circle of eight round the square stem, with a short
space between each circle. You will notice that
the stalks which bear the tiny white flowers
spring from the same part of the main stem as
the leaf circles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. WOODRUFF</h3>

<p>The sweet-smelling Woodruff is common all
over the country, and when dried its perfume
is like new-mown hay. It grows in woods and
on shady hedge-banks, and it flowers in early
summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are small and white, with four petals
which stand round the mouth of a tiny tube.
Inside this tube are four yellow-headed stamens,
and there is a small green sepal-cup in which the
white tube stands. The flowers grow in clusters
at the end of the main stem. They do not rise
from each circle of leaves as in the Goosegrass.
The tiny seeds are black, and each seed is thickly
covered with soft bristles, which are hooked at
the end.</p>

<p>The ridged stem of the Woodruff is often a dull
red colour. This stem is very feeble, so the Woodruff
is usually found lying in a tangle along the
ground. It has not so many hooks as the Goosegrass
with which to catch hold of other plants,
and so raise itself.</p>

<p>The leaves grow about an inch apart on the
stem, in beautiful circles. In each circle there are
eight narrow leaves which are pointed at the end.
The circles nearest the foot of the stem lie flat
open like a rosette, but those that are further up
are usually half closed, with all their points standing
upwards.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. YARROW OR MILLFOIL</h3>

<p>The Yarrow or Millfoil is a very common plant
all over Britain. It grows on waste ground
and in the corners of fields, and it is in flower in
late summer and autumn.</p>

<p>It is one of the daisy plants, and you must look
at it carefully. The flowers grow in clusters,
three or four together, at the end of stalks which
branch from the main stem. They are white, and
look like tiny daisies. You must pick one of them
gently to pieces, and then you will find that each
daisy is really made up of a great many small
flowers crowded together on a disc. The outer
flowers consist of a white tube, with one long
white strap, and there is a row of these white
straps standing out like a frill round the
yellow centre. Inside this white border there are
a great many tiny yellow tube flowers, with five
points at the mouth of each tube, but these you
will not see without a microscope.</p>

<p>Outside this mass of flowers grows a ring of
small green leaves, which are closely packed
together and are very woolly.</p>

<p>The stem of the Yarrow is stiff and smooth and
is slightly tinged with red. The leaves are long
and narrow, and each leaf is made up of many
tiny pairs of leaflets placed opposite each other on
the stem. Each leaflet is cut up into many
divisions, so that the whole leaf is light and
feathery like a small fern.</p>

<br>
<h3>1. OX-EYE DAISY</h3>

<p>The handsome Ox-eye Daisy is common all
over Britain. You find it in flower from
summer to the end of autumn.</p>

<p>It is a plant with a tall, stiff stem that has ridges
running from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Notice how different its leaves are from those of
the small Daisy, though both plants belong to the
same family.</p>

<p>The flowers in the Ox-eye Daisy are very large.
The yellow tube flowers in the centre are crowded
together on a flat disc, and outside this disc there
is a double ring of tiny white tubes, each of which
has one broad white strap. These straps form the
beautiful border to the flower.</p>

<p>At the top of the green flower-stalk there is
a double ring of narrow green pointed leaves.
When the flowers are in bud they look like thick
green buttons, with a yellow spot in the middle,
as these green leaves are tightly folded in a circle
round the flat yellow centre.</p>

<p>The leaves are straggling and very poor-looking
for such a handsome plant. They are feather-shaped,
with the edges deeply cut up into many
blunt points. They have no stalks of their own,
but spring from the main stem.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. DAISY</h3>

<p>This well-known plant is to be found all over
Britain. It is in flower from spring to late
autumn, and I think it is the first flower little
children learn to recognise.</p>

<p>But it is often a long time before they get to
know anything more about the Daisy than its
name, and yet it is an interesting flower, as well
as a pretty one.</p>

<p>If you gather a Daisy, and then gently pick it
to pieces, you find that it is made up of a great
many tiny little flowers crowded together on a
pear-shaped centre. These tiny flowers are of
two kinds; those in the centre are yellow and
are shaped like little tubes, each of which is
edged with five points. But in the outer row of
flowers, one of the five points has grown into a
long white strap, which is tinged with pink and
red at the tip.</p>

<p>These pretty white straps are arranged in a
double frill round the yellow centre.</p>

<p>At the end of the flower-stalk there is a thick
ring of small green pointed leaves, and these, as
well as the stalks, are slightly hairy.</p>

<p>The Daisy leaves grow in a rosette close to
the ground. They are oval, and each leaf has
hairs all over it and round the edges.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<br><h3>3. SCENTLESS MAYWEED</h3>

<p>This daisy plant is very common too. It
grows all over Britain, and is in flower from
June till October.</p>

<p>It is not such a stiff, handsome plant as the
Ox-eye Daisy, but much more branched and bushy,
and it often grows close to the ground. The
stalks are tougher, and they are quite smooth,
with fine ridges running up them.</p>

<p>The flower-heads are made up in the same way as
those of the other daisy plants. You find a mass
of tiny yellow tubes in the centre, and forming
a border round this yellow centre is an outer
ring of flowers, each with one large white strap.</p>

<p>When the Mayweed begins to wither, these
white straps droop towards the stalk, and the
yellow centre, instead of remaining nearly flat,
becomes the shape of a thimble. You will find
many of these yellow thimbles on the plant, after
all the white straps are gone.</p>

<p>The tips of the green leaves, which grow in
a double ring behind the flowers, are often tinged
with pink.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Scentless Mayweed are like
many leaves that grow in running water. They
are divided into a tangle of fine hair-like points,
which spring directly from the main stem without
any stalk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. SNOWDROP</h3>

<p>The modest Snowdrop, with its graceful, drooping
head, grows abundantly all spring in
meadows and pastures and orchards in England
and Scotland. It is not so common in Ireland.</p>

<p>The flower is enclosed in a grey sheath, edged
with bright green lines. After the flower bursts
out of the sheath, it droops from the end of a
slender flower-stalk. Each flower has six white
petals; the three outer petals are boat-shaped
towards the tips, and there are three shorter
petals which are not curved. These straight
petals have a notch cut in the upper edge, and
there is a bright green wavy stain just below
this notch.</p>

<p>Inside these dainty white petals are six yellow-headed
stamens with scarcely any stalks. These
stamens stand on the flat round top of the seed-vessel,
and in the centre rises its short, pointed
pillar.</p>

<p>Notice that the oval green seed-vessel is outside
the circle of white petals, at the top of the
slender flower-stalk.</p>

<p>A single pair of leaves rise from the Snowdrop
root, with the flower-stalk between them. These
leaves look like short straps with blunt points.
They are bluey green in colour, and have deep
grooves running from base to tip.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>2. COMMON STAR OF BETHLEHEM</h3>

<p>This beautiful starry plant is found in many
places in England and in a few in Scotland,
but not in Ireland. It grows in meadows and
pastures and orchards in early summer.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly on long stalks which
branch near the top of the main stem. There is
always a withered-looking brown leaf at the base
of each flower-stalk.</p>

<p>The flowers have six large white petals, which
are pointed at the tips. The back of each petal
is stained with bright green, except round the
edge, where it remains white.</p>

<p>There are six yellow-headed stamens clinging
to the base of the white petals. These stamens
stand up in a circle round a fat green seed-vessel
which sits in the centre of the white petals. This
seed-vessel has a tiny pointed column in the
middle.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Star of Bethlehem are very
narrow. From the middle each leaf tapers to a
long point. These leaves are deeply channelled,
and they have a broad white stripe running down
the centre.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. RANSOMS</h3>

<p>This unpleasant-smelling plant is common all
over the country, except in the North of
Scotland. It grows in woods and copses and on
hedge-banks, and it blooms in early summer.</p>

<p>Each flower grows on a short stalk, in a loose
cluster at the end of a stout juicy stem. When
in bud these flowers are all enclosed in a brown
sheath, which bursts open in two pieces as soon
as the flowers are ready to expand.</p>

<p>Each flower has six narrow white pointed
petals, opening flat out like a star. There is
a short yellow-headed stamen clinging to each
of these white petals. In the centre of the flower,
among the white petals, is a green seed-vessel,
which is divided into three small oval balls. A
slender pillar rises from amongst these small
seed-balls.</p>

<p>There are no sepals in this flower.</p>

<p>The leaves of the starry-white Ransoms are not
unlike those of the Lily of the Valley. They have
long lines running from base to tip, and are a
delicate pale-green in colour.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. MOSSY SAXIFRAGE</h3>

<p>In all parts of the country this slender, graceful
plant is abundant. You will find it growing
on damp banks and on the mountain side, and
it blooms throughout the summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are cup-shaped, and they grow
singly on short stalks which branch from the
main stem near the top. Each flower has five
white petals streaked with fine veins.</p>

<p>Within the petal-cup there is a ring of ten
stamens with yellow heads, and in the centre of
the flower you can see a green seed-vessel like
a small pear, with two wavy points coming out
of the top.</p>

<p>Behind the white petals you find a tiny green
calyx-cup, made up of five little sepals. These
sepals are joined together at the bottom, but
round the mouth of the cup the five points stand
up separately.</p>

<p>The reddish-green stems are slender and wiry.
They have single, little leaves growing up them,
with a short space in between each leaf.</p>

<p>Only some of these stems have flowers at the
top. Others end in a tuft of leaves, and never
bear any flowers. These leafy stems are clothed
with leaves all the way to the tip, and each leaf
is very small and narrow. At the end the leaf is
divided into three small fingers, and these fingers,
as well as the stem, are covered with dark hairs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>2. MARSH PENNYWORT</h3>

<p>This water-loving plant is very common all
over the country in marshes and bogs and
by the sides of ditches. It blooms in summer.</p>

<p>The plant is easily recognised by its round
leaves. These have wavy edges, and fine green
veins running from the centre of the leaf to the
edge.</p>

<p>The stalk is fastened exactly underneath the
centre of the leaf, and it is soft and juicy and
covered with fine hairs.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Pennywort are greenish-white,
tinged with red. These flowers grow in little
clusters of three or four together at the end of
short stalks which spring from the root, close
beside the leaf-stalk. But these flower-stalks are
so short, and the flowers are so small, you recognise
the round leaves long before you discover that
there are any flowers.</p>

<p>The Pennywort is one of those plants with a
creeping stem, which lies along the surface of the
ground. The stem is a delicate, pale pink, and
wherever a bunch of flowers and leaves rises, you
find a tuft of white, hair-like roots growing down
into the mud.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. INTERMEDIATE WINTERGREEN</h3>

<p>It is a great delight to discover this dainty plant.
It is not very common, but in summer and
autumn you find it blooming on heaths in many
parts of the country.</p>

<p>The Wintergreen flowers are not unlike Lily-of-the-Valley.
They are delicate, creamy white bells,
which hang from short drooping stalks near the
top of a slender stem.</p>

<p>These bells have five ivory petals slightly tinged
with pink, which form a dainty fairy cup.</p>

<p>Within the cup there is a ring of ten stamens
with heavy yellow-heads, clustered round the tip
of the green seed-vessel. This green tip rises in
the centre, like a slender pillar, a good way above
the stamens.</p>

<p>Behind the ivory cup is a green star, with five
points. These points are the sepals. Notice that
wherever a flower-stalk joins the main stem a tiny
pointed green leaf appears.</p>

<p>The soft juicy stem is twisted near the top and
is four-sided. It grows straight from the root.</p>

<p>The dark glossy leaves of the Wintergreen are
spoon-shaped, with wavy edges. They spring
from the ground with very short stalks, and they
remain on the plant all winter.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>1. GRASS OF PARNASSUS</h3>

<p>This slender plant grows in bogs and damp
places all over Britain and blooms in autumn.</p>

<p>It has large white flowers, which grow singly at
the end of tall green stalks. These stalks are
square and slightly twisted.</p>

<p>Each flower has five creamy-white petals, covered
with delicate veins. Inside this ring of petals,
lying at the bottom, are five curious scales, like
tiny hands. The hands have each ten fingers,
tipped with yellow dots, so you may count fifty
dots altogether. On the scales are glands which
hold honey. This, you may be sure, the bees very
soon find out.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower is a round pale green
seed-vessel, and in between the scales with the
tiny yellow dots lie five fat stamens with heavy
yellow-heads.</p>

<p>The Grass of Parnassus has also five green
sepals, whose tips you can see appearing in between
each of the five white petals, as you look
down into the flower.</p>

<p>Most of the green leaves of this plant grow from
the root. They are oval, with smooth edges, and
each leaf has a stalk of its own.</p>

<p>But often you will find a single leaf clasping the
flower-stalk half way up its stem, and this leaf
has no stalk of its own.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. COMMON BLADDER CAMPION</h3>

<p>The Common Bladder Campion is to be
found all summer by the edge of fields and
pastures.</p>

<p>It is a tall, slender plant, with white flowers
which grow each on a thin short stalk, two or
three close together at the end of a smooth stem.</p>

<p>The flowers have five petals, and each petal has
V-shaped notches cut in the outer edge. The
lower part of the petals is hidden from sight in the
calyx-cup.</p>

<p>The five sepals which form this calyx-cup are
joined together, and they are swollen like a bladder.
This bladder is covered with a fine network of
reddish veins, and has five teeth round its mouth.</p>

<p>You will easily recognise the Common Bladder
Campion by this curious calyx.</p>

<p>In this white Bladder Campion the stamens
and the seed-vessel are found in the same flower,
and you can always see the forked tip of the seed-vessel,
rising among the dark green heads of the
stamens.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Common Bladder Campion
are smooth and shiny. They grow opposite each
other in pairs, and wherever a pair joins the main
stem, the stem is swollen like the joint of a finger.
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. SEA CAMPION</h3>

<p>The Sea Campion grows by the seashore, by
the side of mountain streams, or on wet rocks
among the hills.</p>

<p>It blooms all summer, and although it is really
a smaller plant than the Common White Campion,
the flowers are larger.</p>

<p>These flowers have five white petals, each with
a V-shaped notch in the outer edge. Half way
down these petals there is a white-fringed scale.
These scales stand up like a crown round the
inside of the flower.</p>

<p>The calyx is swollen like a bladder, and is
covered with fine veins, the same as in the Common
Campion. Round the mouth it has five sharp
teeth.</p>

<p>In this plant the flowers do not grow in groups
of two or three. Each flower appears singly at
the end of a slender stalk, and there are several
pairs of small leaves a good way below the flower.</p>

<p>These leaves are slightly thick and juicy. They
grow so close together on the ground that it looks
as if it were covered with a green mat.</p>

1. COMMON EYEBRIGHT. 2. WHITE DEAD NETTLE. <br>3. SPOTTED ORCHIS.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. COMMON EYEBRIGHT</h3>

<p>This humble little plant is to be found everywhere
on heaths and meadows and pastures.
It blooms plentifully in summer and autumn. The
flowers of the Eyebright grow in clusters of four
to six at the end of the main stem. They are
white, or pale lilac streaked with pink, and they
are small and unattractive. The petals are joined
together into a tube, with two lips at the mouth.
The upper lip has two divisions, and the lower lip
is cut up into three. They appear to be five unequal
petals standing round the mouth of the tube.</p>

<p>Inside the tube are four purple-headed stamens,
two long and two short. You can see them appearing
at the mouth of the tube, also the slender
white point which rises from the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>The calyx is a green cup with four deeply
pointed teeth at the mouth. The tube of the
flower goes down into the cup, and the five unequal
petals stand round its mouth.</p>

<p>The Eyebright stem varies much in height.
Sometimes you find it only about two inches from
the ground, and in other places it has straggled
eighteen inches high. These stems are very
hairy.</p>

<p>The leaves grow opposite each other in pairs up
the stem. They have no stalks, and the edges are
cut all round into blunt teeth. They are rather
hairy leaves, and are dark green and crinkled. In
shape they are oval with a blunt point at the end.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. WHITE DEAD NETTLE</h3>

<p>The White Dead Nettle is fairly common everywhere
except in the North of Scotland. You
find it in waste places, by the roadside, and on
ditch banks, and it blooms from spring to
autumn.</p>

<p>This is a much more attractive plant than the
Stinging Nettle we have all learned to avoid.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in beautiful whorls or circles
round the stem. In this plant the flowers are
snowy white, tinged with green, but in other Dead
Nettles you find them rose pink or deep purple.</p>

<p>There are often as many as eighteen flowers on
one whorl. The flower petals are joined together
into a tube which stands in a shallow calyx-cup,
edged with five very long, sharp teeth. The
mouth of the white flower-tube is cut very irregularly.
The upper part bends over like a hood,
and underneath this hood are hidden the four long
stamens. The lower part of the flower-tube hangs
down like a tongue, and it is fringed and rounded
at the end. Amongst the stamens you see the
slender forked point which rises from the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>The leaves of the White Dead Nettle are very
similar in shape to those of the Stinging Nettle;
but they are a paler shade of green. They grow
in pairs close to the stem, with a good space in
between each pair, and the ring of stalkless
flowers clusters round the stem beside them.</p>

<br>
<h3>3. SPOTTED ORCHIS</h3>

<p>This Orchis is common all over the country,
where it grows in damp woods, on chalky
banks, and in meadows and pastures.</p>

<p>You find it in summer.</p>

<p>The leaves are stained with purplish-black
blotches as in the early Purple Orchis, but they
are narrower and taper more to a point. Notice
the small leaves which cling at intervals to the
flower-stalk all the way up.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in a dense cone-shaped head
at the top of the flower-stalk. The petals are
pale lilac or nearly white, and are spotted or
streaked with purple. They are curiously shaped.
The broad petal, which folds back like a hanging
lip, is deeply waved round the edge, and behind
it there is a long lilac spur.</p>

<p>Two petals stand erect, and form a hood which
covers the stamens and the slender column of the
seed-vessel.</p>

<p>There are also three small lilac or white sepals
which you will scarcely be able to distinguish from
the petals.</p>

<p>The flower sits at the top of what looks like a
swollen stalk, but is really the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>Where this stalk-like seed-vessel joins the main
stem there is always a tiny purple or green leaflet.</p>

1. RED BERRIED BRYONY 2. CHICKWEED WINTERGREEN <br>3. CUCKOOPINT OR WAKE ROBIN</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. RED-BERRIED BRYONY</h3>

<p>The Red-Berried Bryony is very common in the
South of England, where it climbs over the
hedges and grows among the thickets. But it
does not grow wild in the North. It is in flower
all summer and autumn.</p>

<p>The stems of this plant are soft and easily
broken, and they have not enough strength to
keep the leaves and flowers upright. But at the
bottom of each leaf-stalk, there are long curly
green tendrils, and with these the Bryony catches
hold of some stronger plant, which helps to support
it.</p>

<p>The flowers are greenish-white in colour, and
they grow in loose heads which spring from
between the leaf-stalk and the stem.</p>

<p>These flowers have five separate greenish-white
petals covered with a fine network of veins and
with many transparent hairs.</p>

<p>At the back of the petals sits a green calyx-cup
edged with five pointed teeth.</p>

<p>When the flowers are withered they are followed
by groups of beautiful dark red berries.</p>

<p>The Red Bryony leaves are very large, and are
shaped like a hand with five blunt fingers. The
green colour is pale and bright, and each leaf is
covered with short white hairs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. CHICKWEED WINTERGREEN</h3>

<p>It is delightful to find the Chickweed Wintergreen
as it is rather a rare plant. It grows in
fir woods and on heaths in hilly districts, and it
blooms all summer. There is no other plant at all
like this Wintergreen, so you will have no difficulty
in recognising it.</p>

<p>The stem is very delicate and wiry, and at the
end it bears a spreading rosette of six long pointed
leaves. These leaves are smooth and shiny: in
autumn they are often tinged with purple.</p>

<p>You may find one or two solitary leaves lower
down on the stem; if so, these leaves are quite
small, and they are rounded at the ends.</p>

<p>The flowers look like white stars. They have
five or seven long narrow petals with pointed tips.
These petals lie open in a circle, and you can see
five or seven thread-like stamens with tiny pink
heads rising in the centre, round a small green
seed-vessel.</p>

<p>The flower-stalks grow from the centre of the
green leaf rosette. Each flower has a delicate
pink stalk of its own, and you may find three or
four stalks springing from the same place. But
more often the flower is solitary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. CUCKOOPINT OR WAKE ROBIN</h3>

<p>This is one of our most curious wild plants.
It is common in England and Ireland, but
rare in Scotland. It grows on hedge banks and
in open woods, and blooms in late spring and
early summer.</p>

<p>The large glossy leaves are arrow-shaped, and
they are covered all over with dark purple blotches.</p>

<p>From amongst them rises a pale green twisted
sheath, which is completely closed when in bud.
Like the leaves, it is spotted all over with purple
blotches, and the edges are stained a pale yellow-brown.</p>

<p>Inside this sheath rises a tall narrow purple
cone, on a stout green stalk. Fastened round
this green stalk are three curious collars.</p>

<p>First comes a collar of tiny green pear-shaped
glands, of which nobody knows the use. Then
comes a purple collar made up of stamen heads
without any stalks.</p>

<p>And a little way below these there is a deep
band of round green seed-vessels like small beads.
These are hidden in the lower part of the green
sheath; but in autumn they grow much larger, and
soon burst open the covering sheath. Then they
turn into beautiful scarlet berries. These berries
are very poisonous.</p>

<p>The root of the Cuckoopint is a rough brown
knob with many white rootlets hanging from it.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. COMMON MARE'S TAIL</h3>

<p>This strange-looking plant grows in many
parts of the country, and its spikes are found
during summer in ponds and ditches. The
flowers are so tiny that you may scarcely notice
them. They grow in a circle close round the
main stem where the leaves join it, and they are
greenish in colour. These flowers have no petals,
and all you can see is a small green ball with a
yellow dot on the top of it.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Common Mare's Tail grow
in circles up the stem at short distances apart.
They are very narrow and pointed, exactly like
short green straps, and you find from six to
twelve of these strap-leaves in the same circle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. COMMON BUTTERBUR</h3>

<p>The Common Butterbur grows in wet places,
especially beside streams. It is not found
in the North of Scotland, but is common in the
South country. The flowers appear very early
in spring, before the leaves, and they are nearly
withered by the time the leaves are at their best.</p>

<p>The flowers grow closely crowded together
in cone-shaped heads, near the top of a thick
fleshy stalk. These flowers are made up of tiny
pink tubes with toothed edges, and there is a row
of long-headed pink stamens clinging to the inside
of each tiny tube. Outside the head of flowers
there is a thick bundle of narrow green pointed
leaves, and each little bundle of green leaves and
pink tubes has a short stalk of its own.</p>

<p>You will notice the narrow green leaves which
grow singly up this main stem. Sometimes these
leaves become much broader at the tips, and when
this is the case these leaf-tips are dark green and
have toothed edges.</p>

<p>The root leaves of the Butterbur are very large.
They are roughly heart-shaped with sharply cut
teeth round the edge. Each leaf is dark green
and smooth above, but underneath it is woolly,
and the short stalk on which it grows is hollow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. GREATER BURDOCK</h3>

<p>The Greater Burdock grows in waste places
by the roadside and on the borders of fields.
It is fairly common all over Britain and flowers in
autumn.</p>

<p>The Burdock is a low-growing bushy plant
with strong stems. Growing close to the ground
it has large coarse leaves not unlike rhubarb
leaves. They are dark green, very wrinkled, and
with slightly waved edges.</p>

<p>The leaves which grow on the flower-stems are
much smaller, and are long and rather narrow.</p>

<p>The flowers are scarcely seen. They are made
up of small rose-coloured and purple tubes, which
are crowded close together at the end of stout
round stalks. But these small flowers are completely
surrounded by a ball of green bristles, so
that you require to pull the bristles apart and
look into the top of the green ball if you wish to
find the flowers.</p>

<p>Each of the bristles on this green ball ends in
a tiny hook, and with these hooks they cling to
whatever they touch. You often see these prickly
balls sticking to the wool on a sheep's back. If
you throw one at a companion it will hang to his
clothes by its sharp little hooks.</p>

1. MOUSE TAIL. 2. RIBWORT PLANTAIN. <br>3. KNOTTY FIGWORT.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. MOUSE-TAIL</h3>

<p>This little plant grows plentifully in the East
of England, but it is not found all over Britain.
It flowers in summer.</p>

<p>You will easily recognise it by the curious way
the seed-vessels grow. You remember in the
Buttercup (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.) there was a little hard knot
of seed-vessels like a green raspberry in the
centre of the ring of stamens?</p>

<p>The Mouse-Tail is a cousin of the Buttercup,
but the seed-vessels grow on a long pointed spike
which shoots up in the middle of the flower, and
is just like a mouse's tail.</p>

<p>Each flower has five yellowish-green petals,
shaped like pale yellow tubes, with a lip at the
top. There are five long, narrow, yellow-green
sepals, with little spurs at the bottom. And there
is also a ring of stamens with yellow heads which
stand straight up round the foot of the Mouse's
Tail.</p>

<p>The leaves are long and narrow, with a line
down the centre. They are rather thick leaves,
and they all grow in a tuft from the root.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. RIBWORT PLANTAIN</h3>

<p>Is there any child that has not played at
'Soldiers' or at 'Lords and Ladies,' with the
flower-heads of the Ribwort Plantain? It is
common everywhere, and flowers from spring to
autumn.</p>

<p>The narrow pointed leaves grow in a circle
straight from the root. They are dark green on
one side, and silvery green on the other, and have
long 'ribs' running from the bottom to the top.
From these 'ribs' the plant gets its name of
'Ribwort.'</p>

<p>The flowers are closely crowded together in
brown, cone-shaped heads. Each flower consists
of a narrow white tube, with four graceful yellow
points folded back at the mouth.</p>

<p>The large yellow heads of the stamens stand
up beyond the mouth of this tube, but you can
scarcely see the tip of the seed-vessel which is
hidden inside.</p>

<p>When the flowers are fully out, you do not
notice the white tubes; all you see is a big cluster
of fuzzy yellow-headed stamens.</p>

<p>There are four small green sepals at the bottom
of the flower-tube, and these sepals are often
stained with brown blotches.</p>

<p>The stems are ribbed all the way up and are
covered with short hairs. They are juicy and
very easily broken.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. KNOTTY FIGWORT</h3>

<p>This uninteresting plant is abundant everywhere.
It is found in damp, shady places by
the side of ditches, and it is at its best in summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>At first you scarcely notice the flowers. They
are small, dull green bells stained with brown,
and are not at all attractive. But when you
examine them, you find that the mouth of each
bell is prettily waved all round the edge, and inside
there are two long stamens and two short ones, as
well as a fat green seed-vessel, with a curly point
standing up in the middle.</p>

<p>There is a green calyx-cup with five teeth at the
mouth, and as the small green bell soon withers
and falls off, you oftenest notice this calyx-cup
with a green seed-vessel sitting in the centre.</p>

<p>The tiny flower-bells grow in loose clusters,
which spring from between the leaf and the main
stem.</p>

<p>The Knotty Figwort is a tall and stout plant,
with a four-sided stem which is curiously twisted.</p>

<p>Be sure to pull up the root, and you will find it
covered with small bulbs or knots. From these
knots the plant gets its name.</p>

<p>The leaves near the foot of the Knotty Figwort
stem are large and broadly oval, with short stalks.
But those that grow further up the stem are
narrower and more pointed, and they all have the
edges cut like the teeth of a saw.</p>

1. LADY'S MANTLE 2. DOG'S MERCURY. <br>3. COMMON NETTLE.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. LADY'S MANTLE</h3>

<p>The Lady's Mantle is a curious little plant and is
common everywhere in summer. The beautifully
shaped green leaves at once attract you, but
the flowers are so small that you scarcely notice
them. They are crowded into clusters at the end
of short stalks, which branch many times from the
main stem. These flowers have no petals. If you
look at them very closely, you find that they have
eight green sepals, which lie flat open when the
flower is in bloom. These sepals are all pointed,
and vary in size. The four which are utmost
are smaller than the sepals which form the inner
circle.</p>

<p>In the middle of these green sepals there is a
yellow ring, and in the centre of this ring sits the
tiny seed-vessel, sunk almost out of sight. There
are four stamens, each of which stands out separately
from this yellow ring.</p>

<p>The root-leaves of the Lady's Mantle are rounded,
and they are covered with a fine network of veins.
Each leaf looks as if it had been folded into five or
seven folds, and each fold is divided round the edge
into scollops. The edge of these scollops is cut
into sharp teeth. Sometimes you find a big
diamond dew-drop lying in the folds of the Lady's
Mantle leaf.</p>

<p>You will also notice a frill of tiny pointed green
leaves clasping the main stem wherever it forks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. DOG'S MERCURY</h3>

<p>The Dog's Mercury grows abundantly in England
and Scotland but is rare in Ireland.
You find it during early spring in woods and
shady places and thickets.</p>

<p>This is one of our green flowers. It has no
beautiful coloured petals to attract the bees or
insects.</p>

<p>The Dog's Mercury is a bushy, upright plant,
with a stout, four-sided green stem, closely
covered with pretty leaves.</p>

<p>These leaves grow in pairs, on alternate sides
of the stem: they are oval, and slightly hairy, and
the edges are cut all round into sharp teeth.</p>

<p>Where each leaf joins the stem a flower-stalk
rises, and in the Dog's Mercury there are two kinds
of flowers. On one stalk you find groups of small
flowers clustered at close intervals round the stalk.
Each of these flowers has three broadly pointed
green sepals, which curl slightly at the tips. In
the centre of these sepals rises a large bunch of
eight to sixteen yellow-headed stamens. In these
flowers there are no petals, and no seed-vessel.</p>

<p>But you will find different flowers on another
plant. These flowers have also three green sepals,
and are without petals. But in the centre lie two
hairy green seed-vessels, like small peas joined
together, and on the top of these seed-vessels are
two tiny green horns.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. COMMON NETTLE</h3>

<p>What child does not know the Common Stinging
Nettle? We have all learned to avoid
it after having felt its sting.</p>

<p>You find this Nettle everywhere in late summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>It has a four-sided stem, which is rough with
bristly hairs. The leaves grow opposite each other
in pairs with a good space between each pair.
They are dark green and rather coarse, and are
covered with a network of veins and with many
stinging hairs.</p>

<p>Close to the stalk the leaves are heart-shaped,
but the tips are sharply pointed and the edges are
deeply toothed all round.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Common Nettle grow on
slender stalks which rise between the leaf and the
main stem. These flowers are green, and they are
very small and unattractive.</p>

<p>On one flower you find four green sepals and
four yellow-headed stamens, but there are no
petals and no seed-vessel.</p>

<p>In another flower there is a fat green seed-vessel,
with four sepals round it.</p>

1. PURPLE SEA ROCKET 2. CUCKOO FLOWER OR LADY'S SMOCK<br>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. PURPLE SEA-ROCKET</h3>

<p>The Purple Sea-Rocket grows abundantly all
summer on most of our seashores. It is a
bushy plant with many branches, and you will
recognise it by its thick and fleshy green leaves.
The flowers are a pale lilac colour, like those of
the Cuckoo Flower. Some of them grow on heads
at the end of the main stem, and others have short
stalks which branch from each side of this stem.</p>

<p>In this plant there are always buds in a cluster
at the end of the stem, and those flowers that
come out first grow further down the stem.</p>

<p>Behind the lilac flowers there are four small
brownish-green sepals. When these fall off, after
the flower is withered, the seed-vessel which lies
inside grows into a small green pod. The pod is
in two pieces and looks as if it were joined in the
middle. You will see a great many of these tiny
pods growing on each side of the main stalk where
there have been flowers.</p>

<p>The stem of the Sea-Rocket is very smooth and
juicy. The leaves are long and feather-shaped, and
they are cut very irregularly into fingers all the
way round.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>2. CUCKOO FLOWER OR LADY'S SMOCK</h3>

<p>The Cuckoo Flower is very common and grows
all springtime in every meadow.</p>

<p>The flowers are a pale purple or lilac. Sometimes
you find them almost white. They have
four petals, each of which has a slight nick in the
outer edge. There are six stamens with yellow
heads, which you can just see in the centre of the
flower where the petals meet; and you will notice
that two of these stamens are much shorter than
the others.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in a cluster near the end of a
stout stalk. After the petals and the small green
sepals fall off, the seed-vessel, which is in the
middle of the stamens, shoots up into a long thin
pod. This pod is slightly curved, and is pale
brown.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Cuckoo Flower are of two
kinds. Those that spring from the root, close to
the ground, grow opposite each other in pairs of
leaflets, on a stalk which has an odd leaflet at the
end.</p>

<p>But the leaves which appear further up the main
stem are quite different They, too, grow in opposite
pairs, but they are long and narrow like pointed
straps, and are not nearly so pretty as those which
are closer to the ground.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. MARSH CINQUEFOIL</h3>

<p>The Marsh Cinquefoil is not so common as
many plants. It likes best to grow where
there are high hills, and you find it all summer in
wet ground among the peat-bogs.</p>

<p>It has black roots, which creep a long distance
among the mud, and from these roots grow beautifully
shaped green leaves, and rather strange-looking
flowers.</p>

<p>These flowers have five small petals, which are a
deep purple colour. So are the stamens, so are
the seed-vessels. Even the sepals, which are bigger
and longer than the petals, are a rich, dark purple,
except at the foot where they join the stalk, and
there they are greenish.</p>

<p>The Marsh Cinquefoil has two rings of sepals.
Those in the outermost circle are shaped like
a narrow tongue. The inner sepals are much
broader, and they end in sharp points.</p>

<p>The flowers have each a stalk which branches
from the main stem. Sometimes two flower-stalks
will spring from the same part of the stem, and in
that case there will be a large green leaf clasping
the stem where they rise.</p>

<p>These leaves are usually divided into three
fingers, each of which is long and rather narrow,
with sharp teeth all round. There are a few hairs
on the upper side of the leaf, but underneath it
is quite smooth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>4. WATER AVENS</h3>

<p>The Water Avens loves moist places, and in
summer you find it abundantly by the sides of
ditches and streams.</p>

<p>It is a delightful plant to discover, as both the
leaves and the flowers are beautiful.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly at the end of slender
stalks which branch from the main stem near the
top. They are cup-shaped, with heads that are
always drooping.</p>

<p>The petals are bright orange-brown, tinged with
purple, and outside these brilliant petals there is
a calyx of deep purple sepals. These sepals are
lined with bright green and have pointed tips, and
there are many hairs all over them.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower are bright yellow-headed
stamens, and when the flower is withered,
and the seeds begin to ripen, a short green stalk
rises in the middle, and on this there appears
what looks like a small green strawberry. From
every seed on the strawberry there grows a long
spike with a curl in the middle. This spiky seed-vessel
is very curious.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Water Avens are deep green,
and sometimes they have red streaks round the
edges as well as on the back. They grow in pairs
on the leaf-stalk, a large pair and a small pair
alternately, and they are slightly hairy, with edges
which are nicked all round. Where the leaves join
the main stem there is often a tiny scale.</p>

1. DOG VIOLET. 2. HEARTSEASE. <br>3. COMMON MALLOW.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. DOG VIOLET</h3>

<p>The Dog Violet begins to flower early in
summer. You find it growing on banks under
the hedges, a tiny plant with flowers so small
and stalks so short that the flowers are of no use
after you pluck them.</p>

<p>Every child knows what a violet is like, but you
should pick one of the flowers to pieces and see
how curiously each petal is shaped. There are
five petals, and these petals are pale purple at the
broad part, but at the narrow end they are almost
pure white, and this narrow end is hidden among
the green sepals. Four of these petals are nearly
the same size, and on two of them there are
patches of hair near the foot.</p>

<p>The fifth petal is much larger, and the narrow
end of this broad petal is shaped like a round tube.
This tube, instead of being hidden among the
sepals, stands out beyond them like a spur. Inside
the tube are the stamens, and all the yellow
heads of the stamens are joined edge to edge
in a ring round the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>The Dog Violet has five green sepals with very
sharp points, and the lower part of each sepal is
slightly swollen. The leaves are heart-shaped,
with toothed edges, and they grow very close to
the ground and have scarcely any stalks. This
Violet has no scent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>2. HEARTSEASE</h3>

<p>The Heartsease is not quite so common as the
Dog Violet, though in some parts of Britain
it grows abundantly. It is in flower all summer.</p>

<p>The flowers have five petals, but these are not
all the same colour. There are two deep purple
petals and three which are bright orange-yellow.
In the Heartsease the broadest petal has a very
small tube at the narrow end, the same as in the
Dog Violet. There are five pointed green sepals,
which do not fall off after the flower is withered.
You will often see the seed-vessel sitting among
these sepals, and when this seed-vessel is ripe it
splits open into three small boat-shaped cases,
each with a row of seeds inside.</p>

<p>The stem of the Heartsease is round, with distinct
lines running up the sides.</p>

<p>The leaves are oval, on short stalks, and they
have wavy edges. Where they and the flower-stalk
join the main stem you find a fringe of other
green leaves, quite differently shaped. These
leaves have a long name which you will learn later,
but meantime you should notice how they are cut
up into little green straps which stand out all
round the stem.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. COMMON MALLOW</h3>

<p>The Common Mallow is a handsome flower
which grows by roadsides and in waste
places. It is plentiful all summer and autumn.
The five petals are a beautiful pale mauve streaked
with purple. They are long and rather narrow,
and each petal has a deep notch in the outer edge.
These petals do not meet close together at the
bottom; you can see part of the green calyx
appearing between each petal.</p>

<p>In the middle of the flower stands a small purple
pillar. In this pillar all the slender stems of the
stamens are joined together, and their heads
cluster near the top like tiny beads, with the wavy
points of the seed-vessel rising among them.</p>

<p>This Mallow has two kinds of green sepals.
Five of these are broad, with sharply-pointed tips
and hairy edges. And besides these there are
three long narrow sepals.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Mallow are very pretty.
They are shaped like a hand with five blunt points,
and the edges all round are cut into delicate
teeth.</p>

<p>Those leaves which grow close to the root have
often a deep purple blotch near the centre.</p>

1. SCOTCH THISTLE 2. MARSH PLUME THISTLE <br>3. FIELD SCABIOUS</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>1. SCOTCH THISTLE</h3>

<p>This Thistle is very well known, particularly in
Scotland, where it is the national flower. It
blooms in late summer and autumn.</p>

<p>The stem of the Scotch Thistle is very stiff and
straight, with 'wings' at each side. These wings
are pale green flaps edged with very sharp points,
and they run from top to bottom of the stem. The
stem itself is white and woolly.</p>

<p>The Thistle flowers are a dull purple colour, and
grow in a dense head, forty or fifty of them closely
packed together. If you pick to pieces one of
these heads, you will find that it is made up of many
purple tubes which are edged with five purple teeth.
The foot of each tube is enclosed in a covering of
dingy yellow down.</p>

<p>When you have a great many of these flowers
growing close together in a head, the under part
looks like a bundle of woolly down.</p>

<p>Below this down bundle you find a prickly green
covering, in which there are dozens of narrow green
leaves. Each leaf ends in a sharp point, and it is
this prickly green covering which makes the Thistle
such a difficult flower to gather.</p>

<p>The leaves have very sharp points at the edges.
They are dark green, and are thinly covered with
beautiful grey down. The young leaves are
entirely white and woolly until they open.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. MARSH PLUME THISTLE</h3>

<p>The Plume Thistle is very common all over
Britain. It grows during summer in bogs
and in wet places by the roadside.</p>

<p>This tall, thin plant is not nearly so attractive
as the Scotch Thistle.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in heads which contain a
great many dull purple flowers crowded together
in one bundle. These heads do not grow singly
as in the Scotch Thistle. You will find three or
four close together at the end of the main stem,
and there is usually one head of flowers much
further out than the others.</p>

<p>The green covering which protects the lower
part of the flowers and binds them together is
not hard and prickly as in the Scotch Thistle.
When you pick this covering to pieces you find
that it is filled with woolly down.</p>

<p>The stem of the Marsh Plume Thistle is stiff
and straight, and it has green wings with very
sharp prickles up each side.</p>

<p>The leaves are long and narrow, and they are
edged with sharp points. Each leaf is dark green
above, but underneath it is covered with white
down.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. FIELD SCABIOUS</h3>

<p>This pretty plant is common over most of
Britain. You find it on dry banks and by
the edge of fields, and it blooms all summer and
autumn.</p>

<p>The flowers are very interesting. They grow in
a bouquet which contains many flowers crowded
together at the end of a stout stalk.</p>

<p>The centre flowers are a reddish pink colour,
and have many tall yellow-headed stamens standing
up beyond them. The petals of these flowers
are joined together into a tube which is unevenly
divided round the mouth. If you open the tube
gently, you will find that the stamens are clinging
to the inside.</p>

<p>Outside these pinky flowers there is a border
of purply-blue tube-flowers, and these are much
larger than the group in the centre. At the
mouth of each tube there is a purple strap, and
these straps stand out like a frill round the
bouquet.</p>

<p>Behind these flowers there is a double row of
small pointed green leaves.</p>

<p>The stem leaves are shaped like a feather, and
they have long narrow fingers growing up each
side of a centre stalk. There is always a solitary
finger at the end of the stalk, and each finger is
covered with soft hairs.</p>

1. COMMON LING OR HEATHER. 2. BLACK KNAPWEED. <br>3. WILD THYME.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. COMMON LING OR HEATHER</h3>

<p>The Heather is so well known that it scarcely
requires any description. It grows on moors
and commons and mountain-sides in England,
Scotland and Ireland, and in autumn you will
find it covering the ground like a carpet, sometimes
growing in bushes as high as your knee.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Heather are very tiny, and
they vary in colour from a pale pink to a deep
purple. These flowers grow in spikes near the
end of thin woody stems, and each flower has
a very short stalk which droops slightly. The
small flowers are bell-shaped, with the mouth of
the bell deeply divided into four parts. Outside
this purple bell there is a calyx made up of four
purple pink sepals. These sepals are much
longer than the petals, and they are very crisp
and dry, like tissue paper. There is a double row
of tiny green pointed leaves, clasping the bottom
of the purple flowers. At first you might mistake
these for sepals, but they have a different name,
which you will learn some day.</p>

<p>The Heather leaves are very tiny. They have no
stalks, and they grow tightly pressed against the
tough woody stems. When you look at them
closely you see that the edges are rolled back so
as almost to touch each other behind. When
these leaves are withering they are often a
beautiful brown-red colour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>2. BLACK KNAPWEED</h3>

<p>This hard-headed plant is common everywhere,
in pastures and fields and by the roadside,
and it blooms in autumn.</p>

<p>The Black Knapweed is a stiff, soldierly plant,
not unlike a small Thistle without prickles.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in thickly crowded heads each
at the end of a stout stem. These heads are made
up of dozens of tiny purple tubes with the mouth
cut into five straps round the edge. You can see
the forked end of the seed-vessel coming out of
the centre of each tube. The stamens cling to
the sides of the purple tubes, hidden from sight
inside. This cluster of purple tubes grows on the
top of a hard green ball which has a circle of light
brown strap-shaped leaves round the top.</p>

<p>This hard ball is covered with row upon row of
green leaves pressed tightly one above the other,
like the scales of a fir cone.</p>

<p>When the flowers are in bud they are completely
hidden inside this hard green ball, and after the
flowers are withered you see these balls, which
have become dark brown, still clinging to the
ends of the stalks.</p>

<p>The Knapweed leaves vary much in shape.
Some are narrow and long, with edges that are
finely toothed. Some are deeply cut up at the
sides. Those that grow clasping the stem are
broad, and they are smooth all round the edge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. WILD THYME</h3>

<p>This sweet-scented little evergreen grows
abundantly on all sandy and chalky pastures,
and is specially common in mountainous districts.
It flowers in summer and early autumn.</p>

<p>The Wild Thyme trails along the ground in a
thick tangle of wiry stems and tiny glossy leaves.
From this tangled mat some of the stems stand
upright, and these bear masses of small purple
flowers at the top. Other stems end in a tuft of
tiny leaves.</p>

<p>The flowers of the Wild Thyme consist of a
narrow purple tube which stands in a deep green
funnel-shaped calyx. The mouth of the flower-tube
is cut in two, and the upper half has a small
notch in the centre. The lower half is divided
into three blunt points.</p>

<p>Inside the tube, clinging to its sides, are four
stamens. After the flowers are withered you can
see the tip of the seed-vessel coming out of the
mouth of the calyx.</p>

<p>The calyx is funnel-shaped and has many sharp
teeth found its mouth, and there is a fringe of
white hairs just inside.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Wild Thyme are very small.
Sometimes the edges are rolled back till they
almost meet behind. They are dark green and
glossy, with smooth edges, on which you can see
a line of fine hairs.</p>

1. EARLY PURPLE ORCHIS. 2. PURPLE LOOSE-STRIFE. <br>3. COMMON BUTTERWORT.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. EARLY PURPLE ORCHIS</h3>

<p>At the same time of year, and in the same
places as you find the Blue Hyacinth, you
will discover the Early Purple Orchis.</p>

<p>It is a curious plant, and belongs to a family
whose flowers are always strangely shaped.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in a cone-shaped head at the
upper end of a stout, juicy stalk. Each flower
consists of three purple petals and three purple
sepals, and you will not be able to distinguish
which are which. These petals or sepals are
very irregular in shape. One is broad, and hangs
open like a lip. This one has a long purple spur
behind. Two smaller petals rise straight up above
this lip and form a hood. And the others are
shaped in varying ways.</p>

<p>Inside the broad lip with its hood you see a
slender column, in which the one stamen as well
as the point of the seed-vessel are combined.</p>

<p>The flower is placed at the end of what looks
like a twisted purple stalk. This is really the
seed-vessel, and where it joins the flower-stem
there is always a narrow strip of purple leaf.</p>

<p>The leaves have no stalks. They are broadly
strap-shaped with blunt ends, and they have long
narrow lines running from base to tip. Each leaf
is stained all over with purple spots.</p>

<p>The root of the Early Purple Orchis consists of
two egg-shaped knobs, and above these knobs
grow many white, worm-like rootlets.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. PURPLE LOOSE-STRIFE</h3>

<p>The Purple Loose-strife is common in all parts
of England, but you do not find it so abundantly
in Scotland. It is a tall, spiky plant, which
likes to grow in wet places, and it blooms in late
summer and autumn.</p>

<p>The flowers are a rich purple colour which is
sometimes almost pink. They grow in circles
close round the main stem, and there is always a
pair of broad pointed green leaves separating each
circle from the one above.</p>

<p>The flowers have six separate petals, which are
long and narrow and rather crumpled looking.
These petals are placed at the mouth of a green
calyx, which is shaped like a thick tube. This
tube is ribbed all over, and has six large green
teeth and six smaller green teeth round its mouth.
If you gently split open this green tube you find
two rows of stamens clinging to its sides. These
stamens have purply-pink heads, and there are six
long ones which stand up in the centre of the
flowers, and six which are shorter and hidden out
of sight.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Purple Loose-strife are dark
green. Usually they are covered with fine hairs,
but sometimes you find leaves which are quite
smooth. It is easy to recognise this plant by the
rings of flowers growing close round the main
stem.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. COMMON BUTTERWORT</h3>

<p>It is always a delight to find the dainty Butterwort.
It grows in heaths and bogs and
marshes almost everywhere, but is most abundant
in the North. The delicate flowers bloom in
summer.</p>

<p>You will easily recognise this beautiful highland
plant by the leaves. They are thick and juicy, and
grow close to the ground in a pale green star-pointed
rosette. Each leaf is stalkless and as
smooth as satin. On the upper side these leaves
are pale yellow-green, but sometimes the edges
curl upwards, and then you see that the leaf underneath
is so pale that it is almost white.</p>

<p>From the centre of the rosette rise tall, slender
stalks with drooping flower-heads. These flowers
are dark bluey-purple, and their petals are joined
into a short tube which stands in a shallow, toothed
calyx-cup.</p>

<p>The mouth of the tube folds back in two parts.
The upper half is short, with a deep notch in the
middle. The lower half is much longer, and is
divided into three deep scollops.</p>

<p>You will find a pink horn-like spur standing up
near the base of the short tube, and you can see
that the back of the flower is a delicate rose pink
colour. Inside the blue tube there are two stamens
and a curiously shaped seed-vessel hidden from
sight.</p>

1. COMMON BUGLE. 2. GROUND IVY. <br>3. HAIRY WATER MINT.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. COMMON BUGLE</h3>

<p>The Common Bugle is a low-growing plant,
very frequently found in open woods, banks,
and pastures. It blooms in spring and early
summer.</p>

<p>You will not think this a very attractive plant.
The leaves and flowers are crowded together from
top to bottom of the main stem. The stem is pale
purple, and has four sides. It is hollow in the
centre, and breaks off easily because it is soft and
juicy.</p>

<p>The flowers grow without stalks in circles close
to the stem wherever the leaves join it, and each
circle is close to the one above it.</p>

<p>In every flower there is a slender tube, and one
half of this tube folds over at the mouth into three
lips, the centre lip having a notch in the middle.
The other half of the tube stands erect.</p>

<p>These flowers are usually deep blue, but you
may find them purple, or rose colour, or even
white. They are never yellow.</p>

<p>Four golden-headed stamens stand up a good
way beyond the mouth of the flower; two of these
are short and two are much longer. The forked
tip of the seed-vessel can be seen among these
stamens.</p>

<p>The end of each tube stands in a small green
calyx-cup edged with pointed teeth.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Common Bugle are dark green,
and each pair clasps the stem closely at the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p><br>
<h3>2. GROUND IVY</h3>

<p>The Ground Ivy bears little resemblance to the
ivy we all know so well. It is common everywhere,
and blooms in spring and early summer.</p>

<p>The flowers grow without stalks in whorls or
circles close to the stem where the leaves spring
from it. These flowers are dark purply-blue tubes,
prettily divided at the mouth into rounded lips.
The lower lips are marked with white and dark
purple blotches. Inside the tubes are four small
stamens with yellow heads; you can just see them
at its mouth, with the forked tip of the seed-vessel
among them.</p>

<p>There are usually six or more flowers in a whorl,
and each flower has a green calyx-cup which is very
hairy and is edged with five long sharp teeth.</p>

<p>From each side of the stem, close among the
flowers, grow two leaves on pink stalks. These
leaves are round and are beautifully scolloped at
the edge. Each leaf is covered with a network
of veins and is hairy all over, both above and
below, as well as round the scollops.</p>

<p>These circles of leaves and flowers grow at
intervals all the way up the stem, with a good distance
between each circle, and the flowers in the
lowest circles always come out first.</p>

<p>The stem of the Ground Ivy is four-sided. It is
tinged with pink and is very hairy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. HAIRY WATER MINT</h3>

<p>This strong-smelling plant is common everywhere.
It likes to grow in wet places, and it
is in flower towards the end of summer and in
autumn.</p>

<p>The Water Mint is not an attractive plant. It
has four-sided juicy green stems stained with
purple. These stems do not grow straight.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in pink clover-shaped heads,
either at the end of the main stem or sometimes
on very short stalks which spring from between
the stem and the leaf.</p>

<p>Each pink head is made up of many tiny tubes.
These tubes are prettily cut round the mouth, and
you can see four stamens, with deep crimson heads,
coming out of the mouth of each tube. The forked
tip of the seed-vessel is so tiny you scarcely notice
it.</p>

<p>Below the flower there is a deep funnel-shaped
calyx in which each pink tube stands, and both it
and the flowers are covered with fine soft hairs.
There is often a pair of small oval green leaves
just beneath the head of flowers.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Hairy Water Mint are broadly
oval with widely separated teeth round the edge.
They grow in pairs on short stalks on each side
of the main stem, and they are hairy all over.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. COMMON FUMITORY</h3>

<p>The Common Fumitory is abundant in all parts
of Britain, and it blooms in summer. The
flowers grow in loose clusters. Those that are
lowest down the stem come out first, and the buds
are always at the top of the stem.</p>

<p>The flowers are a pretty rose pink colour, but
the tips are often purple, especially before the
flower is fully out. The petals are curiously
shaped. They are joined together into a tube
which is curved at the end, and inside this tube
the stamens and the seed-vessel are hidden. You
will notice that there is a tiny piece of one petal
which is not joined to the others. It stands out
by itself and looks like a small pink tongue, which
broadens at the end. You can always recognise
the Fumitory by this pink tongue.</p>

<p>There are two tiny green sepals with edges cut
like the teeth of a saw, and the pink tube lies in
between these sepals. After the pink tube falls
off, the seed-vessel, which is inside, grows into a
little green knot. You can see many of these
little green knots on the lower part of the stem
where there have once been flowers.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Fumitory are very delicate
and pretty. They are finely cut up into many
little divisions, and each division is a beautiful
shade of grey-green.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. RAGGED ROBIN</h3>

<p>This untidy plant likes to grow in damp places;
it is very common in meadows and in marshes,
and it blooms all summer.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in twos and threes, on short
stalks which branch opposite each other near the
end of a long slender stem.</p>

<p>The petals are a delicate pale pink, and they
are very much cut up into narrow ragged pieces.
You will easily know the Ragged Robin by these
pink petals.</p>

<p>The sepals are joined together into a cup which
is cut into teeth all round the mouth. They are
dark green tinged with red, and have many purple
veins running from top to bottom.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Ragged Robin are shaped
like a lance. They are long and narrow with
smooth edges, and they grow opposite each other
in pairs, closely clasping the stem. Those leaves
that grow close to the ground have sometimes
short stalks.</p>

<p>The upper part of the sticky stem is dark red
in colour, and it is usually rough.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. RED CAMPION</h3>

<p>This pretty summer plant is fond of damp
places like its cousin the Ragged Robin.</p>

<p>It has pink flowers, which usually grow in pairs
at the end of slender stalks branching from the
main stem. Sometimes you may find a single
flower growing on a small stalk in between two
pairs on much larger stalks.</p>

<p>There are five petals, each with a deep nick in
the centre, as if a three-cornered piece had been
cut out. These petals lie flat open round the
rim of the reddish-green cup formed by the
sepals; and if you pull the sepals apart, you find
that the petals have long strap-shaped ends which
go right down into the cup.</p>

<p>There is a curious thing about this plant. You
find one pink flower with a bunch of stamens
inside the cup. You can see their tips peeping
out where the pink petals all meet together.
There is no seed-vessel in the middle. And in
another plant, that looks just the same till you
examine it, you find no stamens, but instead there
is a green seed-vessel in the centre of the cup,
with fine, wavy green threads at the top which
stand out where the petals join.</p>

<p>The stem of the Red Campion is red and sticky,
and the leaves grow opposite each other in pairs
which clasp the stem.</p>

<p>If you crush the leaves and stalks they give out
a strong scent which is not pleasant.</p>

<h3>1. DOVE'S-FOOT CRANE'S-BILL</h3>

<p>The Dove's-foot Crane's-bill is known to us all.
You will find it flowering by the roadside
from May to September.</p>

<p>The flowers are small and pink, sometimes almost
purple. They have five petals, each with a notch
in the broad end and with many fine hairs near
the narrow end.</p>

<p>The flowers open flat, like a wheel, and you
can see the green tips of the sepals appearing
between each of the pink petals, as you look down
into the flower.</p>

<p>After all the pink petals have fallen off, a thin
green spike shoots up in the middle of the sepals.
These sepals no longer lie flat open, but half
closed, they form a green cup. The spike holds
the seeds, and when it is time for them to be
scattered over the ground, five green threads
loosen themselves from the bottom of the spike
and curl up nearly to the top. At the end of each
of these green threads there is a seed, and very
soon the green threads crack and the seeds fall
to the ground.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Dove's-foot Crane's-bill are
very soft and downy. They are round in shape
and are covered with fine hairs. Each leaf is
divided into seven parts, which are toothed round
the edges.</p>

<p>This plant has a weak stem, which lies near the
ground. It is tinged with pink, and is very hairy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. HERB-ROBERT</h3>

<p>The Herb-Robert is common everywhere in
early summer. It is a cousin of the Dove's-foot
Crane's-bill, but differs from it in some points
which you must notice. The stems are much
stronger and can stand upright.</p>

<p>The flowers are longer than those of the Dove's-foot
Crane's-bill, and the five petals have no notch
in the broad end, and no hairs at the narrow end.
These petals are pale pink, streaked with white
or purple, and they grow in pairs at the end of
short stalks which branch near each other from
the main stem.</p>

<p>The sepals are of two kinds. You have three
outer sepals which are green and hairy, and
inside these there are two others which are very
thin and almost colourless.</p>

<p>The seeds of the Herb-Robert are scattered in
the same way as those of the Dove's-foot Crane's-bill.</p>

<p>You will always know this plant by its beautiful
red leaves. They are shaped like a hand, and are
cut up into many tiny fingers. At first they are
green, but very soon they become a beautiful red
colour. So do the stalks.</p>

<p>The whole plant has a strong and rather unpleasant
odour.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. STORK'S BILL</h3>

<p>The Stork's Bill is very well known. In
summer it grows plentifully on dry ground,
especially near the sea coast.</p>

<p>The flowers grow on short stalks. You will
find a bunch of five flower-stalks rising together
at the end of the main stem. Each flower has
five pretty pink petals with smooth edges. These
pink petals soon fall off, and you then notice a
long green spike coming out of the green cup
formed by the sepals. Each green spike is
supposed to resemble a stork's bill, and from this
resemblance the flower gets its name.</p>

<p>When the plant is ready to scatter its seeds,
many fine green threads loosen themselves from
the spike, and curl round and round like a corkscrew.
At the end of each green thread there
is a seed. When the seed is ripe, both the seed
and the corkscrew-thread separate from the spike
and fall to the ground.</p>

<p>The green leaves of the Stork's Bill are cut up
into leaflets which are arranged on each side of
a centre stalk, but not always exactly opposite
each other. There is always a single leaflet at
the end of this centre stalk.</p>

1. REST HARROW. 2. SAINTFOIN. <br>3. RED CLOVER.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>1. REST HARROW</h3>

<p>The Rest Harrow is to be found in sandy places
near the sea, and blooms all summer.</p>

<p>It belongs to the Pea family, along with the
Broom and the Whin. But in this plant the
flower-petals are a beautiful rose-pink colour.</p>

<p>The largest petal, which is called the standard,
is streaked with veins of deep red. The two side
petals, or 'wings,' are pale pink, and the tip of
the two 'keel' petals, which are joined together
into a little boat and hide the stamens, is also a
deep rose-red.</p>

<p>The flowers have scarcely any stalks. They
grow close to the main stem, in a green calyx-cup
edged with five sharp teeth, and there are small
green leaves beside each flower.</p>

<p>These leaves are dark green in front but are
much paler behind, and they have tiny teeth all
round the edges.</p>

<p>Sometimes, close to the root, you find leaves
which grow in threes, but oftenest the plant has
single oval leaves, and these are always covered
with fine hairs.</p>

<p>The Rest Harrow usually lies close to the
ground, but you may find it growing upright like
a small bush.</p>

<p>It has long, tough roots, which creep through
the soil, and these are said to be so strong they
will turn aside the harrow when it is drawn over
the field.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. SAINTFOIN</h3>

<p>Some people tell us that this is not a British
wildflower, but one which was brought from
some other country to grow in our gardens.
They say that the wind and the birds carried away
the seeds, and the plant learned to grow among
our other wildflowers. In any case, you find its
handsome flowers adorning chalky banks and
cliffs all summer and autumn.</p>

<p>Like the Rest Harrow it is a relation of the Pea
family, but its flowers grow quite differently.</p>

<p>In colour they are not such a clear pink. The
two petals which hide the stamens are almost
purple, and the side wings are so tiny, at first
you scarcely notice them.</p>

<p>The flowers grow close together in the shape
of a cone; you find twelve or more open flowers
with no leaves among them, crowded together
near the upper end of a long flower-stalk, and at
the top of this flower-stalk there is always a
bunch of buds.</p>

<p>The calyx is a green cup with five sharp teeth
round the mouth, and it is covered with woolly
hairs.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Saintfoin are long and
narrow, and the edges are quite smooth. Each
leaf is made up of from eight to twelve pairs
of leaflets growing opposite each other on a leaf-stalk,
and there is always a solitary leaflet growing
at the end of the stalk.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. RED CLOVER</h3>

<p>The Red Clover is as well known as the Buttercup.
It grows all summer in every hayfield.
Sometimes the flowers are large and showy, and
sometimes they are quite small.</p>

<p>The Red Clover is a member of the Pea family,
though at first you may not think that the flowers
are at all like those of the Broom or the Rest
Harrow. These flowers grow in a round head,
thirty or forty of them close together at the end of
the flower-stalk.</p>

<p>If you pull a single flower apart from the others
and separate the petals, you will see that they are
shaped in the same way as those of the other Pea
plants.</p>

<p>You find one large standard petal which stands
erect, rather a long, narrow petal in this plant.
Then there are two side petals for the 'wings,' and
two front petals joined together so as to form a
tiny boat, and in this boat the stamens and seed-vessel
are hidden.</p>

<p>These petals are a pale pinky-red, and each
flower is set in a green calyx-cup edged with five
long teeth.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Red Clover are 'Trefoils'; that
means that they grow in groups of three. Each
group has a short stalk, and there are curious
yellow markings in the centre of each oval leaf.
The edges are smooth, and the leaves are covered
with fine downy hairs.</p>

1. DOG ROSE 2. BURNET ROSE <br>3. LOUSEWORT OR RED RATTLE</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. DOG ROSE</h3>

<p>There are a great many wild roses, pink,
white, and crimson, but the pink Dog Rose
is the commonest. Every one has gathered it in
the sunny June days.</p>

<p>You must notice a curious thing about the seed-vessel
of this plant. Only the top of it rises in the
middle of the stamens. But if you look at the
back of the flower, you see a small green swelling
at the end of the stalk, and the sepals and petals
and the stamens stand in a ring round the top of
this swelling. This is the seed-vessel, and in
autumn, after the flower is withered, it will grow
into a round red berry, which is called a hip.</p>

<p>The sepals of the rose are very pretty. They are
cut up into many points like small leaves, and after
the flower is withered these points fold right back
and cover the green berry. Later on they dry up
and fall off, leaving the berry bare.</p>

<p>The rose leaves are too well known to need any
description. Notice the two narrow green leaves,
like wings, which grow at the foot of the leaf-stalk,
clasping the main stem.</p>

<p>The Dog Rose is very thorny. There are large
hooks all over the main stem, as well as close to
the flower, and these hooks are often coloured a
bright crimson.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. BURNET ROSE</h3>

<p>The Burnet Rose is different in several ways
from the Dog Rose. It grows in early
summer on sandy sea shores and on heaths, but
not in the hedges, and the flowers are usually
white.</p>

<p>It is a much smaller plant than the Dog Rose.
Its leaves grow closely crowded together in a
small, low bush, and there are no long shoots
running out from the plant.</p>

<p>The main stem of the Burnet Rose is a bright
pink colour, and instead of having big hooks here
and there it is covered from top to bottom with
fine sharp prickles of all sizes.</p>

<p>The green sepals are pointed, but they are not
cut up into leafy tips as in the Dog Rose. Neither
do they fold back over the seed-vessel after the
flower is withered, but remain standing straight
up at the top of the berry.</p>

<p>The seed-vessel of this rose is rounder than the
hip of the Dog Rose. When ripe it is a dark
purple colour which is almost black.</p>

<p>The leaves are made up of leaflets which grow in
pairs opposite each other on a leaf stalk, and
there is always an odd leaflet at the end of the
stalk. They are small, nearly oval, and the edges
are cut all round into fine teeth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. LOUSEWORT, OR RED RATTLE</h3>

<p>This bright plant is common all over the country.
It grows in wet places, such as bogs and damp
fields, and it is in flower from spring to autumn.</p>

<p>The Lousewort is a small plant and does not
rise very far above the ground. The flowers are
bright pink, and they grow singly at intervals up
the main stem. The flowers are curiously shaped.
The lower part is round, like a narrow pink tube,
but at the mouth this pink tube becomes much
wider and is divided in two. One half rises straight
up and then bends over at the top like a hood.</p>

<p>Inside the pink hood are hidden the yellow heads
of the stamens. The other half of the flower is
divided at the edge into three pink scollops, which
fold back so that you can look inside the tube of
the flower. After the pink flowers are withered
the calyx-cup swells into a small bladder, and on
windy days you can hear the seeds rattling inside
this bladder.</p>

<p>The stem of the Lousewort is hairy, and the
leaves grow very close to it. These leaves are
made up of small fingers with deeply toothed
edges, which grow in pairs on each side of the
centre leaf-stalk. There are frequently six pairs
of these fingers on one stalk, and there is always
a single finger at the end of the stalk.</p>

1. GREAT WILD VALERIAN 2. SMALL BINDWEED <br>3. FOXGLOVE</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>1. GREAT WILD VALERIAN</h3>

<p>You find the Great Wild Valerian in most parts
of Britain. It grows in marshy meadows and
in damp woods, and is in flower all summer.</p>

<p>The Wild Valerian is a tall, handsome plant. It
has small pale pink flowers, which grow in thick
clusters on long, stiff green stalks rising from the
main stem.</p>

<p>If you pull off a single flower you find that its five
pink petals are joined together at the bottom into
a tube. This tube folds back at its mouth into five
pink scallops, and you can see three yellow-headed
stamens coming out of the mouth of the pink tube.
If you gently split the tube open you will discover
that these stamens are clinging to its sides.</p>

<p>The green sepals of the Wild Valerian are also
joined into a tube which has five teeth at the top,
and after the pink petals are withered, this green
tube sends up a tuft of beautiful feathery down.</p>

<p>The stem is dark and glossy. It is ribbed all
over and is hollow inside.</p>

<p>In the Wild Valerian each leaf is divided into
fingers, which grow in pairs on each side of a
slender stalk. Sometimes there will be ten pairs
of these little fingers, and you will notice that each
finger is not placed exactly opposite its neighbour,
but that they grow alternately.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. SMALL BINDWEED</h3>

<p>The Small Bindweed or Convolvulus is common
everywhere. You find it in the hedge-banks,
on waste places and in fields, and it blooms all
summer.</p>

<p>This pretty plant is very well known by its pale
pink or pure white flowers. These flowers have
a narrow tube which fits into the small green
sepal-cup. But round the mouth this tube widens
out into a beautiful bell, and the edges of the bell
are gracefully waved all round. Inside the flower
there are curious markings like large cream-coloured
rays, and you must notice how wonderfully
the flower of the Bindweed is folded when it
is in bud.</p>

<p>The stem of the Bindweed is very curious. It is
twisted like a piece of rope. This stem clings to
any stronger plant within reach, and it will twist
itself round and round that plant till it nearly
chokes it.</p>

<p>The leaves are dark and shiny with smooth
edges, and they are shaped like the head of an
arrow. Each leaf has a short stalk of its own.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. FOXGLOVE</h3>

<p>This is one of the handsomest of our wildflowers.
It grows abundantly in woods,
on banks and in fields, and it flowers all summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>The Foxglove is a tall plant with a very stiff
stem, from one side of which hang beautiful rose-pink
and purple bells.</p>

<p>These fairy bells are daintily scolloped round the
mouth, and the pale pink lining inside is dotted all
over with purple spots. When you look down the
mouth of a Foxglove bell you see that two long
and two short stamens with large yellow-heads are
clinging to its side, and rising from the centre of
the bell there is a fat green seed-vessel which
sends up a slender yellow thread.</p>

<p>Those bells which are nearest the bottom of the
stem come out first, and the buds are always
found at the top. Behind each bell there are five
green sepals with sharp points, and wherever the
flower-stalk joins the main stem there is always a
small green leaf.</p>

<p>The Foxglove leaves are broad and long, and
they are pointed at the end. Each leaf is covered
with a network of fine veins. These leaves are
grey-green in colour, and the underside is hoary
with soft, white woolly down.</p>

1. BROAD-LEAVED WILLOW HERB 2. CORN COCKLE <br>3. CROSS-LEAVED PINK HEATH</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. BROAD-LEAVED WILLOW HERB</h3>

<p>The Broad-leaved Willow Herb is common in
most parts of Britain. You find it growing
on old walls, in woods and under hedges, and it
blooms all summer and autumn.</p>

<p>It is a tall, thin plant, and has small pink
flowers with four petals, each of which has a
V-shaped notch cut in the outer edge. Behind
these pink petals there are four narrow pointed
green sepals, and within the flower grow eight
stamens with tiny yellow heads. Amongst these
stamens you can see the slender pillar which
rises from the seed-vessel; it is divided at the top
into four yellow rays.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly, each at the end of a
long thin pod which is slightly red in colour.
When the petals and the green calyx fall off, this
pod grows larger, and as soon as the seeds inside
are ripe, it splits open into four strips, and each
strip is lined with a row of small brown hairy
seeds.</p>

<p>The leaves of this Willow Herb are oval, with
pointed tips, and they are cut into sharp teeth all
round the edge. These leaves are dark green,
and usually they are smooth all over, but you
sometimes find leaves which have hairs along the
veins.</p>

<p>The stem is quite smooth, and it is red on the
side which gets most sunshine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>2. CORN COCKLE</h3>

<p>The Corn Cockle is common everywhere. It
grows in the cornfields, and you find its pink
flowers all summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are large and handsome. In shape
they are like a Primrose, but the petals are pale
pink and each has a tiny notch in the outer edge.
On these petals there are tiny lines of dark purple
dots, like rays, which run from the centre of the
flower almost to the edge of the petal. The heads
of the stamens can only just be seen in the centre
of the flower where the five petals meet.</p>

<p>Behind the pink flower there is a green calyx-cup
marked with ten ridges, and at the mouth of
this cup there are five narrow green teeth, which
are so long they look like pointed leaves. These
sepals are dark green inside, but the outside is
pale green and woolly. You can see their sharp
points standing out beyond each of the petals of
the flower.</p>

<p>The stem of the Corn Cockle is stiff, and it grows
very straight. Like the calyx-cup, it is covered
with soft white wool.</p>

<p>The leaves grow in pairs on each side of the
stem. These leaves are long and narrow, with
pointed ends. Each leaf is dark green above, but
the back is always pale grey-green and woolly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. CROSS-LEAVED PINK HEATH</h3>

<p>This waxen Pink Heath is to be found all over
the country. It grows best in damp places,
and is in flower in late summer and autumn before
the purple heather is fully out.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in clusters of from five to
twelve at the top of the woody stem. Each
cluster is made up of pale pink waxy bells, and the
mouth of each small bell is edged with four pointed
teeth. If you split open one of these pink bells,
you will find inside a round green seed-vessel like
a tiny pea.</p>

<p>There is a long green spike growing from the
top of this seed-vessel, and you can see its point
coming out of the mouth of the pink bell. There
is also a ring of yellow stamens hidden inside the
bell, and these grow close round the green seed-vessel.</p>

<p>The leaves of this Pink Heath are very small
and pointed, and they have hairs along the edge.
They grow in fours, and are placed crossways at
short distances up the main stem. The edges are
usually rolled back on to the woolly underside of
the leaf.</p>

<p>The stem of the Cross-leaved Pink Heath is
slender and wiry, and this pretty plant is never
found growing in large bushes like the common
heather. Sometimes the flowers are pure white.</p>

1. BLUE MEADOW CRANE'S-BILL 2. MILKWORT<br>3. CORN FLOWER OR BLUE BOTTLE 4. TUFTED VETCH</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. BLUE MEADOW CRANE'S-BILL</h3>

<p>The Blue Meadow Crane's-bill is one of our
handsomest wildflowers. It is to be found
by the edge of the fields and in the meadows all
over Britain in summer and autumn.</p>

<p>This plant is related to the beautiful geranium
which grows in our gardens. The flowers have five
large petals. In front these petals are bright blue
and are painted with tiny pink streaks. Behind,
they are a delicate pale pink.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower there is a ring of
stamens, and within this ring is the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>There is a circle of green sepals behind the
pinky-blue petals.</p>

<p>After the blue petals are withered you can see a
long spike with a small star at the end coming
out from among the sepals.</p>

<p>This spike has five seeds clustered round the
bottom, and whenever these seeds are ripe, the
spike splits into five fine hairs. Each of these
hairs curls up to the top, carrying a seed with it.
Then the five seeds are blown by the wind away
from the slender hairs.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Blue Meadow Crane's-bill are
beautifully shaped. They are like a hand with five
thin fingers, and each of these fingers is deeply
cut up all round the edges.</p>

<p>The stem of the plant is covered with rough,
hairy bristles.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. MILKWORT</h3>

<p>The Milkwort has flowers which are not always
the same colour. You may find them either
pink, or blue, or white, but I think the blue Milkwort
is the commonest. It blooms all summer.</p>

<p>The flowers grow on spikes in which the buds
are always at the top, and further down the same
spike there are leaves. Each flower has five
sepals. Three are only small green strips, but
inside these three there are two which are large
and broad, and beautifully coloured. These look
like petals.</p>

<p>When the flower is withered these two sepals
change colour and become green.</p>

<p>The real petals are paler in colour than the
sepals. The lowest one is cut up at the end into
little strips like a blue fringe, and there are two
small side petals as well as two upper ones, which
are so tiny that they are merely scales.</p>

<p>The leaves resemble narrow straps. They grow
alternately on the stem, and they are dark green
above and pale green below.</p>

<p>The Milkwort lies close to the ground among
the grass. You would never notice it, were it
not for its beautiful spikes of blue, pink-white
flowers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. CORN FLOWER</h3>

<p>The Corn Flower or Blue Bottle is common all
over Britain; you find it in the cornfields
and by the roadside, and it flowers all summer and
autumn.</p>

<p>This pretty plant belongs to the same family as
the Thistles. The flower-heads are made up of a
great many flowers grouped together. In the
outer row you find a circle of beautiful bright blue
flowers, each of which consists of a blue tube which
widens out at the mouth like a trumpet, and is
edged with seven sharp points.</p>

<p>Inside this outer circle there is a mass of darker
blue flowers, slightly tinged with rose-colour.
These flowers are very much smaller, and their
pinky tubes are very tiny. So are the strap-shaped
teeth at the mouth of the tube. Coming out of
the mouth of each tube is the dark purple tip of
the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>Underneath this bunch of flowers there is a
double ring of green scales with fringed edges.
These scales are tightly pressed together in the
shape of a cup, but they are not prickly as in some
of the Thistles.</p>

<p>The stems of the Corn Flower are very tough.
The plant is tall and straggling, and it has narrow
strap-shaped leaves with smooth edges. These
leaves, as well as the stems, are often covered with

<h3>4. TUFTED VETCH</h3>

<p>The Tufted Vetch is a very common plant, and
all summer-time you find its masses of bright
blue or purple flowers growing up the hedges. It
belongs to the large family of Pea-plants, along
with the Broom and the Trefoils, and you will find
that its bright bluish-purple petals are shaped as
curiously as those of the other Pea-plants.</p>

<p>Do not forget to look at the stamens. You will
see that there is one stamen whose slender stem
is not joined with the others, but has a separate
stalk of its own.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in clusters on a stiff stalk;
the buds are at the end of the stalk, and the
flowers that grow lowest on the stalk always open
first. When the flower is withered, the seed-vessel
grows into a small green pea-pod which has
a curly tail at the end, and when the seeds are
ripe, this pod turns brown.</p>

<p>The leaves are made up of short pointed straps,
set opposite each other in pairs on each side of a
thin stalk. You will often find ten pairs of little
straps, and at the end of the stalk there grow curly
green threads called tendrils. This Tufted Vetch
is one of these climbing plants which are not
strong enough to stand alone; so these tendrils
curl themselves round the twigs of the hedges,
and this helps the plant to rise high above the
ground.</p>

1. WILD SUCCORY. 2. BLUEBELL OR HAREBELL. <br>3. SEA HOLLY.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. WILD SUCCORY</h3>

<p>The Wild Succory is abundant all over England,
but is not so plentiful in Scotland. It grows
by the borders of fields, in waste places or by the
roadside, and it blooms in late summer and
autumn.</p>

<p>The flowers are like large blue dandelions.
They have no stalks, but grow from top to bottom
of the main stem.</p>

<p>The flowers at the bottom of the stem come out
first and the buds are always at the top. Each of
these large blue dandelions is made up of a great
many tiny tubes grouped together.</p>

<p>In the inner circle there are a great many blue
tubes which have no strap, but in the outer circle
the flowers have a broad blue strap at one side,
and the end of this strap is cut into fine teeth. In
the centre of each tube you see the tip of the seed-vessel
standing up. It looks like a white thread
with two curly points at the end.</p>

<p>The heads of the stamens are placed edge to
edge and form a collar close round this white
thread.</p>

<p>Behind the blue flowers there is a green calyx-cup
of narrow strap-shaped leaves, with reddish-brown
tips. There is always a large pointed
green leaf where the flower-bud joins the main
stem.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Wild Succory are rough and
hairy all over, and are a grey-green colour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. BLUEBELL OR HAREBELL</h3>

<p>The Bluebell or Harebell is one of our prettiest
wildflowers. It is common all over the
country on heaths and on pastures, and it blooms
in late summer and autumn.</p>

<p>The five petals of the flower are joined together
into a beautiful bell. This bell is divided round
the mouth into five pointed scollops, and when
you look into the mouth of the bell you can see
the yellow heads of the five stamens and the
three-cornered top of the seed-vessel.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly, on many very slender
stalks which branch from the main stem.</p>

<p>The green calyx-cup behind the Bluebell is
curiously marked with raised lines. It is deeply
divided into five sharp green points, which stand
out like the rays of a star at the back of the Bluebell.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Harebell are of two kinds.
Those that grow on the main stem, where the
flower-stalks branch from it, are narrow and
pointed. But the leaves that spring from the
root are quite different.</p>

<p>They are nearly round, with edges which are
cut into large teeth, and each leaf has a stalk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. SEA HOLLY</h3>

<p>This curious plant grows on sandy seashores
in England, but it is not common in Scotland,
and it will not grow far North.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in clover-shaped heads at the
ends of very stiff stems. These flowers are very
small, of a whitish-blue colour, and they are not
at all attractive. If you examine one closely you
find that the petals stand straight up, and each
petal has a pointed beak which bends forward
towards the centre of the flower. The stamens
also curve inwards.</p>

<p>Outside this cluster of flowers there is a crowded
mass of small green leaves, and each leaf ends
in three short points. These leaves are a yellow-green
colour, but all the rest of the flower is a
beautiful grey-blue.</p>

<p>The stems of the Sea Holly are stiff, with ridges
running up them, and the leaves have no stalks
of their own, but grow in a circle of three or five,
tightly clasping the main stem. These leaves are
very smooth and thick. They are grey-blue in
colour, with yellow-green patches between the
veins, and they have very hard edges which are
waved all round. Each of these waves ends in a
sharp point.</p>

<p>The Sea Holly is quite as prickly as the Christmas
Holly, and as it grows low down among the
sands, bare-footed children must be careful not
to stand on it.</p>

1. GERMANDER SPEEDWELL. 2. BROOKLIME SPEEDWELL.<br>
3. GREAT WATER FORGET-ME-NOT.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. GERMANDER SPEEDWELL</h3>

<p>This bright blue flower is to be found on banks,
and in woods and pastures all over the country.
It blooms in spring and early summer. Many
people call this the Forget-me-not, but that is
not correct, and you should notice carefully the
difference between the two plants. They are not
really alike.</p>

<p>The Germander Speedwell is a slender, wiry
plant, whose stem sometimes creeps along the
surface of the ground before it grows upward.</p>

<p>The flowers have four small petals of the
brightest blue, and within the flower at the foot
of the petals is a small white circle, like a little
white eye looking up.</p>

<p>Two stamens with crimson heads rise from
this white circle, and in the very centre of the
flower there is a tiny green seed-vessel, with a
spike coming out of the top.</p>

<p>The four sepals are very narrow green straps
with sharp points.</p>

<p>The dark green hairy leaves are oval, with the
edges cut all round like the teeth of a saw. They
have no stalks, and they grow in pairs opposite
each other. The slender stems, which bear the
flowers in loose heads near the top, spring from
between the leaf and the main stem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<br>

<h3>2. BROOKLIME SPEEDWELL</h3>

<p>The Brooklime Speedwell is quite as common
as its cousin the blue Germander Speedwell,
but it grows in damp places. You find it in
ditches and beside slow-running streams, and
the flowers are in bloom from spring to autumn.</p>

<p>The plant has a round juicy stem, which is
hollow in the middle. It rises straight up from
its muddy bed.</p>

<p>The flowers have four small petals which are
a dull blue in colour, and are not very attractive.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower there is a tiny blue
ring, and to this ring are fastened the two red-headed
stamens.</p>

<p>The seed-vessel is a small green dot with a spike
at the top. It is so tiny that you can scarcely see
it until the blue petals have fallen off.</p>

<p>Behind the flower there are four small green
sepals.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Brooklime Speedwell are
smooth and glossy. They are oval with blunt
points, and the edges are waved. These leaves
grow in pairs opposite each other, and have very
short stalks which widen out at the foot so as to
clasp the stem.</p>

<p>The flowers grow in loose heads on a long
thin stalk, which springs from between the leaf
and the stem.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. GREAT WATER FORGET-ME-NOT</h3>

<p>Every child knows the pale blue Forget-me-not
with its dainty flowers. It has many
varieties which are found all over the country, but
the Water Forget-me-not is one of the loveliest,
and grows abundantly in ditches and marshes
from spring to autumn.</p>

<p>It is a tall straggling plant, with long flower-stalks
which grow singly on alternate sides of
the stem. Those flowers nearest the bottom of
the stalk come out first, and they soon fall off.
The pink buds are always at the very top of the
stem, and the full-open flowers are close below
them.</p>

<p>Each flower has five small round blue petals
which lie open like a wheel, and in the centre of
the flower there is a bright yellow eye.</p>

<p>The stamens are hidden from sight in the small
blue tube below the petals. So is the seed-vessel.
There is a green calyx-cup which is hairy all
over, and round the mouth it is edged with sharply
pointed teeth.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Forget-me-not are long and
narrow, with blunt points and smooth edges.
They are as glossy as if they were wet, and they
clasp the stem.</p>

<p>The lowest part of the stem is four-sided and
hairy, and it creeps along the mud before it rises
up to bear the leaves and flowers.</p>

1. COMMON BORAGE. 2. EVERGREEN ALKANET. <br>3. WOOD HYACINTH.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. COMMON BORAGE</h3>

<p>The Borage is not a very common plant, though
it is widely distributed throughout the
country. You find it on hedge-banks and in
waste places, and it blooms in summer and
autumn.</p>

<p>It has beautiful bright blue flowers, with five
petals which are gracefully pointed at the tips.
These flowers droop either singly or in clusters
at the end of stout, hairy stalks.</p>

<p>The stamens of the Common Borage have no
thread-like stalks; their purple heads are placed
close together in a circle round the slender white
pillar of the seed-vessel. Notice the curious
purple horns that rise from the back of each
stamen. There is a ring of dark purple scales
with white blotches on them at the base of the
petals. The calyx has five long narrow pointed
sepals. These are covered with bristly hairs, and
so are the leaves, stalks, and stem.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Borage are a dusty grey-green
colour. Wherever the stem forks, you find a
large stalkless leaf clasping it. These leaves are
usually oval, but they are very varied in shape,
and those leaves that rise from the root are
frequently quite different.</p>

<p>The stem is light green and is round, with a
hollow in the centre.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. EVERGREEN ALKANET</h3>

<p>Some people do not consider this one of our
native plants, but it is widely distributed
over the country. You find it in hedge-banks and
by the roadside in spring and autumn.</p>

<p>The Alkanet is an erect, hairy plant, which is
not quite so bristly as its cousin, the Common
Borage.</p>

<p>The flowers have small blue tubes, lined inside
with white, and there is a deeply waved sky-blue
wheel round the mouth. When in bud the flowers
are deep pink. These flowers grow either singly
or two or three together, at the end of straight
stalks which rise from between the leaf and the
stem.</p>

<p>There are five purple-headed stamens clinging
to the white lining of the tube, and there is also a
tiny seed-vessel. These you cannot see until you
pick the flower to pieces.</p>

<p>The mouth of the calyx-cup is edged with five
blunt points, and it is covered with soft hairs.</p>

<p>The leaves also are covered with soft hairs and
have scarcely any stalks, but grow singly on alternate
sides of the stem. These leaves are oval,
with smooth, regular edges. They are olive-green
above and bluey-green underneath.</p>

<p>If you cut the stem across, near the ground, you
will see that it is six-sided. It is a juicy stem, with
scarcely any hollow in the centre, and it is covered
with fine, soft hairs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. WOOD HYACINTH</h3>

<p>The graceful Wood Hyacinth is one of our
prettiest flowers. You will find the woods
and hedge-banks covered with its masses of pale
blue flowers in late spring and early summer.</p>

<p>The leaves appear first,&mdash;long, narrow green
straps, with a point at the end, and each green
strap looks as if it had been folded in the middle
and not quite flattened out again.</p>

<p>These leaves spring from a bulb which lies
deeply buried in the ground. Underneath this
bulb are a few white thread-like roots.</p>

<p>The Hyacinth flowers grow, all on one side,
towards the end of a tall and juicy flower-stalk.
This flower-stalk droops when the flowers are in
bud, and again when the flowers are faded. But
it stands proudly erect when its bells are in full
bloom.</p>

<p>Each bell is made up of six long, narrow petals.
These petals are really separate, but about half
way down, they touch each other and so form a
bell. The tips of each petal fold back at the mouth.</p>

<p>There is a yellow-headed stamen clinging to
the side of every petal, and in the centre of the
bell sits a green pear-shaped seed-vessel, with a
short pillar on the top. In the Wood Hyacinth
there is no calyx.</p>

<p>Every blue bell hangs from a short stalk of its
own, and wherever a flower-stalk joins the main
stem there are two narrow pointed leaves.</p>

1. FIELD GENTIAN. 2. SEA ASTER. <br>3. VIPER'S BUGLOSS.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<br>
<h3>1. FIELD GENTIAN</h3>

<p>The Field Gentian is to be found in damp pastures
all over the country, especially in Scotland,
where it is very plentiful. It blooms in late
summer and autumn.</p>

<p>It is a stout, upright plant, but not very tall.
The short stalks, which fork from the main stem
and bear the flowers, stand straight up very stiffly,
and the main stem itself is very firm, and has ridges
running from top to bottom.</p>

<p>The flowers grow singly, each on its own stalk.
They consist of four lilac-blue petals with the
lower parts joined together to form a tube.</p>

<p>At the top of this tube, the petals fold back in
four points, and within the tube, standing close
up round the mouth, there is a blue fringe.</p>

<p>Inside the blue tube are four stamens clinging
to its sides, as well as an upright, green seed-vessel.</p>

<p>The four bluey-green sepals are unequal in size.
The two inner ones are narrow, with pointed ends;
the outer sepals are much broader, and they are
blunt at the tip.</p>

<p>The dark green leaves grow in pairs, opposite
each other, and they clasp the main stem closely.
These leaves taper to a point, and have long veins
running from the broad part to the tip.</p>

<p>There is very often a single flower-bud growing
close to the stem, where the leaves meet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. SEA ASTER</h3>

<p>This somewhat dingy-looking plant loves to
grow in muddy salt marshes close to the seashore;
you find it in bloom all round our sea-coasts
in autumn.</p>

<p>The Sea Aster is a stout, coarse plant, with
straight, stiff stems which are ribbed from top to
bottom. The dark green leaves are shaped like
a sword, and as they have no stalks, they clasp
this rough stem closely on alternate sides. These
leaves are thick and fleshy, with smooth edges.</p>

<p>The flowers grow on short stalks, in dense heads
which branch from the upper part of the main stem.
These heads are made up of two kinds of flowers.
In the centre you find a crowded mass of tiny yellow
tube-flowers which are evenly notched all round
the mouth. And outside these yellow flowers is
arranged a double ring of tiny tubes, each of which
has a broad, blue strap at one side. These blue
straps stand out like a frill all round the centre
bouquet of yellow flowers.</p>

<p>These flower-heads are placed in a green cup,
composed of row upon row of small green pointed
leaves, laid closely one above the other, like the
scales of a fir-cone.</p>

<p>After the flowers are withered, the seeds still
cling to the end of the stalk, and each seed is
winged with a tuft of dingy white cotton down.
When the seeds are ripe, the wind blows them
away from the plant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. VIPER'S BUGLOSS</h3>

<p>The first thing you will notice about the Viper's
Bugloss is the way the rows of flower-buds
curl like a scorpion.</p>

<p>The plant is common in most parts of the
country, in waste places, by shingly sea
beaches, and on chalky soil. It flowers in summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>The Viper's Bugloss is a stout, upright plant,
with a curious pale green hairy stem, which is
dotted all over with red spots. From this thick
stem others, small and thin, branch on alternate
sides, and drooping from the end of each stem is
a double row of bright pink buds. The pair of buds
nearest the main stem open first, and when in
full bloom the flowers are usually bright blue, but
sometimes you will find them deep purple or
white. These flowers are bell-shaped and they
open wide at the mouth, which is unevenly divided
into five graceful points.</p>

<p>Each flower sits in a green calyx-cup edged
with five sharply pointed teeth.</p>

<p>There is a row of narrow green pointed leaves,
standing up like a cockscomb behind each row
of flowers. These leaves curl over at the tip,
along with the buds, and they uncurl as the
flowers open.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Viper's Bugloss are rough
and hairy, with smooth edges.</p>

1. RED POPPY 2. SCARLET PIMPERNEL <br>3. COMMON SORREL</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>1. RED POPPY</h3>

<p>The Red Poppy is known and beloved by
children. You find it in all parts of the
country in summer and autumn, growing among
the corn, on the railway banks and under the
hedges.</p>

<p>The flower has four bright red petals, and of
these the two outer are larger than the two inner.</p>

<p>These petals are soft and silky, with wavy
edges. When they first burst their green covering
they are tightly folded and are much crinkled all
over. But after a day in the sunshine they unfold,
and all the crinkles disappear.</p>

<p>Sometimes you find a bright purple spot at the
bottom of each scarlet petal.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flower sits a curious green
cup with a lid, and this lid is covered with dark
rays which look like the legs of a spider. This
green cup is the seed-vessel, and as soon as the
seeds are ripe, they pour out through a row of
little holes which open just beneath the green lid.</p>

<p>There is a ring of black-headed stamens standing
up all round the green seed-cup.</p>

<p>The Red Poppy has two green sepals. These
are very thin and hairy, and they drop off almost
as soon as the flower opens.</p>

<p>Each Poppy grows on a long slender stalk
which is covered with hairs. The leaves are
divided into many narrow fingers, and they are
rough and hairy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>2. SCARLET PIMPERNEL</h3>

<p>This fragile plant is very common. You find
it in cultivated fields as well as by the roadside
and in waste places. It blooms in summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>This Scarlet Pimpernel is one of our few red
flowers. It has five round scarlet petals, which
are joined together like a wheel. In the centre
of the wheel there is a seed-vessel, the size of a
tiny green pea, and closely clustered round its
thread-like pillar are five yellow-headed stamens.
The slender stalks of the stamens are covered
with hairs, and so are the edges of the scarlet
petals.</p>

<p>The calyx consists of five narrow green sepals,
with sharp points: these you can see appearing
between the edges of the petals as you look down
into the flower.</p>

<p>Each flower grows singly on a short, fine stalk,
and these flower-stalks always rise between a
leaf and the stem. The stem is four-sided, and
it is very easily broken. It is a very feeble stem,
and straggles along the ground.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Scarlet Pimpernel are small
and oval, with smooth edges and blunt points.
They have fine lines running from base to tip,
and underneath they are a blue-green colour, with
little dots all over them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<br>
<h3>3. COMMON SORREL</h3>

<p>You find the dull crimson Sorrel everywhere.
It grows in meadows and pastures and open
woods, and it is abundant all spring and summer.</p>

<p>The flowers are small and unattractive. They
grow on a spike in whorls or circles, with five to
eight flowers in each circle, and these circles are
separated at short distances.</p>

<p>Each flower droops from a tiny stalk. It has
three narrow green sepals, which fold back close
to the stalk when the seed is ripening. Inside
these sepals are three dull crimson petals, also
small and narrow. But when the flowering time
is past, these three petals grow broad and oval,
and become thicker, and at the base of each petal
you see a tiny swelling, which is the seed.</p>

<p>The stem of the Common Sorrel is tinged with
pink. It is ribbed all over, and is very juicy. Both
it and the leaves are acid to taste and are often
eaten in salads.</p>

<p>The leaves are quite smooth, with the edges
uncut. They are dark green above, but much
lighter underneath. Each leaf is shaped like an
arrow-head, and those close to the root have a
long stalk.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
